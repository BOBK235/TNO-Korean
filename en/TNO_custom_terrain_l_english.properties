berlin코0=Germania
berlin_desc코0=Renamed after Germany's victory, Berlin was completely transformed into the largest city on Earth after the war. The cost was one of many causes of the collapse of the German economy, and construction of the city was never truly finished, much of the city being left to deteriorate.
la코0=Los Angeles
la_desc코0=§BCity of Angels§! as the Spanish used to call it, §YLos Angeles§! is the biggest city on the West Coast and boasts the second largest populus, rivaling that of §RNew York City's.§!
laport코0=Port of Los Angeles
laport_desc코0=Acquired from the Americans during the peace negotiations, the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles serve as forward bases for the Japanese Navy and are a show of Japanese might.

sanfran코0=San Francisco
sanfran_desc코0=§YSan Francisco§!, or as the young ones call it: "§BSan Fran§!," is the second largest city around the West Coast area. What it lacks in population, it makes up for in density. San Francisco is the second most densely packed city, only comparable to the §RBig Apple§! itself.
