#ideas
FRA_economic_meltdown코0=Economic Meltdown
FRA_economic_meltdown_desc코0=Following our defeat in the Second World War, our economy has become evermore reliant on that of the Reich. Pressured into the failed German attempt to turn the Reichsmark into a single European currency, the '50s German economic crash has now left us with a ruined currency controlled entirely by another country. Yet whilst the Germans may have begun to see signs of recovery, the light at the end of our tunnel appears a long way away.
FRA_the_OAS코0=The OAS
FRA_the_OAS_desc코0=The Organisation Armée Secrète, or OAS, serves as the secret police force of the state. Specialising in counter-terrorism operations, for the past decade they have dedicated themselves to combatting the lingering Résistance forces across France. Unfortunately, pressure on the government to eradicate this element of society has led to the OAS becoming increasingly empowered to a now alarming rate. With several notable incidents now of OAS commanders ignoring the instructions of government, police and military officials, many in the government fear the OAS may only grow more bold in time.
FRA_the_treaty_of_vichi코0=The Treaty Of Vichy
FRA_the_treaty_of_vichi_desc코0=For the French people the Second World War was a short and humiliating affair, but the Germans delivered their greatest blow with the enforcement of the Treaty of Vichy. Blaming France for the bloodshed of both world wars, the treaty places heavy restrictions upon our military capabilities, effectively reducing our army to a ceremonial force. Yet the treaty also restricts what kind of research the state can sponsor, places a number of political regulations upon our system and effectively grants Germany unlimited access to French territories with which to do as they please.
FRA_les_annees_noires코0=Les Années Noires
FRA_les_annees_noires_desc코0=Surviving largely upon his popularity alone, the death of Maréchal Pétain has marked the end of tolerance for our fascist regime from much of the population. Tixier-Vignancour enjoys none of the popularity of the late Maréchal, with marches in major cities having become far from a rare occurrence. Despite the efforts of our state security services, the popularity of all manner of ideological thought is skyrocketing across France as our people now seek for and demand alternatives to fascism in France.
