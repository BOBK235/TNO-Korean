SIA_THENEWORDER_DESC코0=While costly, the choice to aid Japan in liberating East Asia was an easy one. Thailand has seen the most gains from the conflict and is now one of the few that can stand equal to Japan. Hosting the strongest and most independent economy of Southeast Asia, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and his government have been able to reinvest that wealth back into the country. However with the Prime Minister's failing health, whispers are growing on how the nation will fair once he passes. Lines are being drawn between differening factions in the military and it is only a matter of time before the Japanese turn their attention to securing a tighter hold on their "dearest" ally.

### National Spirits
SIA_thai_for_thai_pridi코0=A New Thailand
SIA_thai_for_thai_pridi_desc코0=Pridi's reforms to the Thai cultural mandates have created a new Thai nationalism, not one based on hate and supremacism, but one based on pride in one's country. This new nationalism, while being less fanatical and zealous than Phibun's nationalism, is inclusive of all Thai peoples.
SIA_integrated_minorities코0=Integrated Minorities
SIA_integrated_minorities_desc코0=The many minorities of our nation have been integrated into our government as equal citizens. Rather than being forced to adopt Thai language and culture, every culture within our nation will be allowed to practice their own customs in their own ways, and minority languages will be taught in schools.
SIA_liberalised_economy코0=Liberalised Economy
SIA_liberalised_economy_desc코0=Pridi's economic reforms have liberalised the nation's economy. Trade has been opened to countries such as India and the United States, and state control of the economy has been decreased.
SIA_liberalised_economy_oof코0=Side Effects of Liberalisation
#     SIA_liberalised_economy_oof:0 "The economic reforms of Pridi have led to some unintended side effects. Many people have lost their jobs due to outsourcing, and many businesses have shut down due to the added weight of not just Japanese, but Indian and American competition. We may need to implement some new programs in order to fix this." #duplicate loc key
SIA_pridi_military_resistance코0=Military Opposition
SIA_pridi_military_resistance_desc코0=Although the coup itself has been defeated, the military is still heavily right-wing, and heavily opposes us. This opposition must be either dealt with or satisfied if we are to secure our government's place.
SIA_pridi_military_resistance_compromise코0=Compromise with the Military
SIA_pridi_military_resistance_compromise_desc코0=In exchange for support from several important military figures, we have made some concessions to certain more moderate right-wing elements. However, we are still opposed by some elements in the military.
SIA_pridi_military_purge코0=Military Purged
SIA_pridi_military_purge_desc코0=We have purged our military of those who would opposed democracy. Although we are now safe from a coup, it has come at a cost to our armed forces, as a large part of our military command had connections with the putschists.
SIA_pridi_right_wing_death_squads코0=Paramilitaries Running Rampant
SIA_pridi_right_wing_death_squads_desc코0=Although the main thrust of the coup has been defeated, far-right paramilitaries mobilized by the putschists continue to rampage through the countryside, terrorizing peasants accused of sympathising with our regime, and harassing our forces when they attempt to stop them.
SIA_pridi_moderate_right_wing_death_squads코0=Integrated Paramilitaries
SIA_pridi_moderate_right_wing_death_squads_desc코0=Rather than eliminating the paramilitaries entirely, we have integrated them into our military, in exchange for them shedding their more radical beliefs. They will help us fight dissent within the ranks, and drum up support for our regime.
SIA_thai_civil_war코0=Thai Civil War
SIA_thai_civil_war_desc코0=The Thai Civil War has erupted, pitting the left-wing nationalist Federalists against the conservative monarchist Loyalists. While both sides claim to be members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, neither side wishes to involve Japan, or any other country, in Thai internal affairs. At least not yet.
SIL_thai_civil_war코0=Thai Civil War

### Events
thai.1.t코0=The Kingdom of Thailand
thai.1.d코0=The year is 1962, and the shine has begun to wear off of the glorious resurgence of the Muaeng Thai.  In the last 25 years, Thailand has largely prospered under the rule of its beloved Chomphon Por, Plaek Phibunsongkhram.  Phibunsongkhram was an early adherent to the new fascist ideologies on the rise in Europe during the 30s.  Acceding to power in 1938, he modeled his government and reforms explicitly on the changes Mussolini had made to Italy.  He modernized and westernized areas of Thai life as wide-ranging as clothes, film, and eating utensils; but the most effort was expended on creating a national state as respected and all-pervasive as Italy or Germany are. True to his title, Phibunsongkhram took full advantage of the miraculous fascist victories in Europe by launching several campaigns into surrounding French and British territory while the Japanese were still largely tied down on the Burmese and Chinese fronts.  However, Phibunsongkhram's manic dreams of dominion over the entire peninsula were quickly dashed when the Japanese quickly moved to occupy any remaining western colonial holdings following the end of the war.  Towards the end of the decade, matters grew worse when severe flooding of the Chao Phraya river left almost a million dead and the nations infrastructure in tatters.  The Japanese Zaibatsus pounced and aggressively secured extremely favorable trade deals.  This devastated Bangkok's industry and threw Thailand into chaos as it became a resource-based economy virtually overnight. After a decade of increasing economic inequality and stagnant industry, opposition to Phibunsongkhram is on the rise.  The outlawed "Democrat Party" organizes openly, demonstrating the government's increasing impotence.  Phibunsongkhram is aging.  His subordinates have already begun jostling for succession.  With the world gearing up for another war, perhaps there's room for an old Chomphon Por to ride into battle one more time...
thai.1.a코0=Interesting
thai.2.t코0=Phibun's Death
thai.2.d코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the brave and loyal Prime Minister to King Rama IX, was found dead this morning in his bed. He was given a funeral with full state honors, and will forever be remembered as a hero of Thailand. However, while it was hoped that the succession would be peaceful and orderly, it seems it may not. Both the democrat Pridi Banomyong and the conservative Luang Wichitwathakan are known to harbor ambitions to the Prime Ministership, and with the monarch in Tokyo there is no clear arbiter of who shall succeed Phibun.
thai.2.a코0=Worrying
thai.3.t코0=Thanom Kittikachorn Seizes Bangkok
thai.3.d코0=Thanom Kittikachorn, Field Marshal of the Royal Thai Army, has used his forces to seize control of Bangkok in the name of 'protecting' the city from 'dissidents' and 'traitors'. Luang and Pridi are known to still be out of the city, and are no doubt corresponding to try and get this new power broker on their side.
thai.3.a코0=A new player, perhaps?
thai.4.t코0=Thanom's Decision
thai.4.d코0=Thanom is now in total control of the capital, and martial law has been declared. However, no new Prime Minister has officially been declared. This decision now seems to fall to Thanom himself in lieu of royal arbitration. Both Luang and Pridi have claimed themselves as the legitimate Prime Minister, but so far neither of them have their own armies. Of course, Thanom could attempt to seize power for himself...
thai.4.a코0=Thanom supports Pridi
thai.4.b코0=Thanom supports Luang
thai.4.c코0=Thanom supports himself
thai.5.t코0=The New Cabinet
thai.5.d코0=Thanom has taken power for himself, and his first action is to reshuffle the old cabinet and stuff it with his loyalists. Old Khana Ratsadon officials are being removed and replaced with 'better' candidates.
thai.5.a코0=For Strength and Stability!
thai.6.t코0=The King Returns from Tokyo
thai.6.d코0=While the power struggle of Phibun's succession was taking place, King Rama IX was in Tokyo on a diplomatic mission. Now he has finally returned, and has decided to accept the new state of things. The transfer of power has been a fait accompli.
thai.6.a코0=Good
thai.7.t코0=Thanom Kittikachorn Dies
thai.7.d코0=Thanom Kittikachorn, loyal and courageous Prime Minister to His Majesty Rama IX, has unexpectedly died today of a liver failure. This death comes at an inopportune time for the nation, as it is in the midst of prominent student and peasant protests. Some say this could embolden the leftist militants in our country.
thai.7.a코0=Uh-oh
thai.8.t코0=Ultra-Right Coup
thai.8.d코0=The various far-right paramilitaries in our country, namely the Nawaphon, Red Gaurs, and Village Scouts, have mobilized and attempted a coup against our government, likely incited by King Rama. They have gained the tacit support of a sizable section of our military, and now the only thing that stands between them and a successful coup is Thanom Kittikachorn himself.
thai.8.a코0=Thanom remains loyal to the government and the coup fails
thai.8.b코0=Thanom switches his allegiance and the coup succeeds
#     thai.8.t:0 "Choosing a new Prime Minister" #duplicate loc key
thai.9.d코0=Now that the disloyal Pridi has been deposed, it is time for King Rama to choose a new Prime Minister. The various paramilitaries have all put forward their own suggestions. The more military-oriented and nationalist Red Gaurs have put forth Sangad Chaloryu, an Admiral and Nazi sympathiser. The Buddhist fundamentalist Nawaphon are split on the issue, some supporting the current Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, Ariyavangsagatayana V, with other Nawaphon members and some Village Scouts dismissing him as too moderate, supporting the radical monk Phra Kittiwuttho instead. Of course, Rama IX could finally restore absolute rule.
thai.9.a코0=Sangad Chaloryu
thai.9.b코0=Phra Kittiwuttho
thai.9.c코0=Restore absolutist rule
thai.9.e코0=Ariyavangsagatayana V
thai.10.t코0=Aftermath of the Attempted Coup
thai.10.d코0=Though the coup has been beaten, a sizable investigation into the instigators has revealed the deep-seated problems and disloyalty present in our country. The traitorous paramilitaries still roam Thailand, and the monarch maintains a great deal of influence. The military establishment, as well as the Khana Ratsadon establishment, are also contributing to this resistance. Pridi has realized that although he has managed to become Prime Minister, he will need to act quickly and get reforms in motion if he wishes to stay in power.
thai.10.a코0=For a new Thailand
thai.11.t코0=Thai General Elections, [GetYear]
thai.11.d코0=The first general elections of the Thai Federation are to be held this year. Three main parties are contesting to the elections. The Khana Ratsadon, led by Pridi Banomyong, the current ruling party, looks like it has the best chance to win, being the only legal party for a long time and led by the immensly popular Pridi Banomyong. The Democrat Party, led by Seni Pramoj, is doing surprisingly well in the polls due to their more moderate policies on the economy, especially among the middle class. Slightly to the left of Seni is his brother, Kukrit Pramoj, who is leading the Social Action Party. The votes are coming in, and...
thai.11.a코0=Pridi Banomyong of the Khana Ratsadon wins!
thai.11.b코0=Seni Pramoj of the Democrat Party wins!
thai.11.c코0=Kukrit Pramoj of the Social Action Party wins!
thai.12.t코0=Thai General Elections, [GetYear]
thai.12.d코0=Four years have passed since the last election, and the three parties have put forward candidates to run in the general elections. The votes are coming in, and...
thai.12.a코0=Pridi Banomyong of the Khana Ratsadon wins!
thai.12.b코0=Seni Pramoj of the Democrat Party wins!
thai.12.c코0=Kukrit Pramoj of the Social Action Party wins!
thai.13.t코0=Thai Parliamentary Elections, [GetYear]
thai.13.d코0=After years of military rule, parliamentary elections are to be held this year. Three main parties are contesting to the elections. The Khana Ratsadon, led by Pridi Banomyong, the current ruling party, looks like it has the best chance to win, being the only legal party for a long time and led by the immensly popular Pridi Banomyong. The Democrat Party, led by Seni Pramoj, is doing surprisingly well in the polls due to their more liberal positions compared to Pridi, who has backed down on his more progressive positions to appeal to royalists. Slightly to the left of Seni is his brother, Kukrit Pramoj, who is leading the Social Action Party. The votes are coming in, and...
thai.13.a코0=Pridi Banomyong of the Khana Ratsadon wins!
thai.13.b코0=Seni Pramoj of the Democrat Party wins!
thai.13.c코0=Kukrit Pramoj of the Social Action Party wins!
thai.14.t코0=Thai Parliamentary Elections, [GetYear]
thai.14.d코0=Four years have passed since the last election, and the three parties have put forward candidates to run in the parliamentary elections. The votes are coming in, and...
thai.14.a코0=Pridi Banomyong of the Khana Ratsadon wins!
thai.14.b코0=Seni Pramoj of the Democrat Party wins!
thai.14.c코0=Kukrit Pramoj of the Social Action Party wins!
thai.15.t코0=The death of Wan Waithayakon
thai.15.d코0=Wan Waithayakon, a prominent Thai diplomat, has passed away this morning.  Waithayakon has served the Thai government for over 50 years, and remained with the government through both the people's revolution and the military coup of 1933.  Though personally an advocate for traditional Thai practices and customs, Waithayakon served as one of the Champhon Por's most able instruments through the most crucial periods of his rule. He served as liason to the IJA during the early 40s, and played a central war in obtaining Japanese recognition of Thailand's conquests.
thai.15.a코0=The end of an era, Thailand may never see his like again.
thai.16.t코0=The death of Direk Jayanama
thai.16.d코0=Opposition leader Direk Jayanama died in Sydney after a long battle with lung cancer.  Jayanama was an enthusiastic supporter of the People's Revolution of 1932, and reluctantly stayed with the government through the 1933 coup and military rule.  However he was disgusted with Phibunsongkhram's fascist program and his alignment with the Japanese against the people's of southeast Asia, and resigned towards the end of the war.  Since then he has lived in exhile in Austronesia, writing in both English and Thai and attempting to organize democratic resistance from afar.
thai.16.a코0=Good riddance!
thai.17.t코0=The death of Pao Pienlert Boripanyutaki
thai.17.d코0=Pao Pienlert Boripanyutaki died suddenly in his office of a stroke today.  Though his long administration saw the state's debt steadily grow, Boripanyutaki is best remembered for his decisive action in the years following the war, where he bucked Phibunsongkhram publically in order to detatch the Thai baht from the yen.  He was quickly proven correct in this decision as the yen has remained in perpetual chaos ever since.  Meanwhile the Thai baht has remained relatively stable and popular among both Thai citizens and the Zaibatsus.
thai.17.a코0=Order a new line of bills with his likeness be printed!
thai.19.t코0=The Thai Cultural Mandates
thai.19.d코0=The Thai Cultural Mandates were a series of 12 decrees given by the government of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram during the Second World War. The mandates aimed to create a uniform and "civilized" Thai culture, however, it is now clear that many of the mandates are outdated and antidemocratic. These decrees will have to be seriously reformed or discared in order to create a democratic Thailand.
thai.19.a코0=Let's get to work!
thai.20.t코0=The Dawn of the Thai Federation
thai.20.d코0=In a speech in Bangkok today, Pridi Banomyong officially abolished the Kingdom of Thailand, symbolically tearing up a picture of the King. As the masses of students and peasants cheered, Pridi continued into his stump speech about the need for his three principles of democratization, independence, and modernity (a concept borrowed from Sun Yat-Sen and the Kuomintang). The Kingdom of Thailand is to be reorganized into the Thai Federation, and elections are scheduled for two weeks from now, and already Pridi's reformed Khana Ratsadon, the Democrat Party (now firmly in the hands of the left), and the Socialist Party have all announced their candidates. Pridi has taken the seat of Provisional President, and it seems like he will be the favorite to win the election. However, all this is assuming the Federation survives another two weeks. While in the north and the cities, the announcement was met with euphoric celebration, in the more conservative sectors of our country, especially the military, talk has been brewing of another coup to reinstate Rama IX as King of Thailand.
thai.20.a코0=Three Cheers for the Federation!
thai.21.t코0=WIP
thai.21.d코0=WIP
thai.21.a코0=WIP
thai.21.b코0=WIP
thai.30.t코0=Monarchist Uprising!
thai.30.d코0=A coalition of generals and political figures have coalesced in the Malay peninsula to issue a pronouncement... WIP
thai.30.a코0=Send in the remaining army to defend Tanintharyi
thai.30.b코0=Pull back to defend Bangkok
thai.31.t코0=Failure in Tanintharyi!
thai.31.d코0=Our forces in Tanintharyi experienced a complete failure. After suffering a few stinging defeats, many generals and commanders who we wrongly thought to be loyal to us defected, and the few remaining loyalist forces fled, broken and humiliated. Not only have we lost some of our best commanders, the Loyalists (as they wrongfully call themselves) have taken the opportunity to push ever closer towards Bangkok, taking over the Rayong province. Although a last minute defense prevented Bangkok itself from being captured, the situation seems dire, and it is unlikely that we will be able to crush the rebellion without a full-scale civil war.
thai.31.a코0=We will march on!
thai.32.t코0=Success in Tanintharyi!
thai.32.d코0=Our forces in Tanintharyi have managed to achieve a partial success! After facing a few initial defeats, our commanders and soldiers held firm, inflicting stinging defeats on the Loyalists (as they wrongfully call themselves). The Loyalists have been driven out of Tanintharyi, and the Loyalists were too busy regrouping from the defeat to advance into our vulnerable eastern flank. However, we were unsuccessful in pushing further into the Malay Peninsula, and it seems like this revolt will not be crushed without a full-scale civil war.
thai.32.a코0=We will march on!
thai.33.t코0=Thai Civil War
thai.33.d코0=The initial shock of the Loyalist uprising has subsided, and battle lines appear to have settled themselves. While the Loyalists have managed to entrench themselves in their positions, and survive the first Federalist counterattacks, they failed in their objective of a bloodless coup, and it remains to be seen whether this initial momentum will transfer into lasting influence. The Federalists, while losing large portions of the country, still maintain strongholds, especially in the North, and it seems unlikely that they will be brushed aside easily. The only question remaining is who we will side with.
thai.33.a코0=We march for the future of Thailand! (Play Federalists)
thai.33.b코0=We march for the King! (Play Loyalists)
