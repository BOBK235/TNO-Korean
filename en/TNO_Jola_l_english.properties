POLITICS_EMILE_BEDIANE_DESC코0=The concept of a Jola nation is a relatively new one. Before recent times, the region of Casamance was simply another part of Wolofia. The people there lived as Wolofians did, and the region was quite normal for the chaos of West Africa.\n\nThat is, until one man started raising a fuss.\n\nEmile Badiane was born in 1915, and became a stellar student in school. His passion for education never died, as he became a school teacher after his graduation. For a time, that seemed to be the highest power he would reach in his life. When the war came and went, however, Badiane saw his chance to become something more, and entered politics. There, he found a movement he was all for- the independence of the Jola people, of which he was one.\n\nDeftly cutting through any and all opposition, he became the spokesperson of the Jola in the mid-50's. From there, a quick series of massive protests, long-winded speeches, and constant obstructions forced Wolofia to hold a referendum on independence, which narrowly passed. With that behind him, Badiane officially declared the Jola Republic and seceded.\n\nNow, Badiane leads the Jola into a new age for West Africa. Staunchly isolationist, Badiane continues to rest on his laurels and accomplishments of years past. While this has earned him much respect as a founding father of the nation, it does not grant him many supporters. With a surging opposition growing more and more threatening every day, it remains to be seen whether Badiane can continue his rule. If he cannot control the politics of Jola as he controlled the schoolyard long ago, his days are surely numbered.
