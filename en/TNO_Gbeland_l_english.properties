POLITICS_IBRAHIM_BABANGIDA_DESC코0=There are a few important things to know about Ibrahim Babaginda. He is the chosen leader of the Gbe, except he isn't. He holds the power in Gbeland, which he doesn't. Finally, he is not in over his head, which he is.\n\nBorn in the middle of the Second World War, Babaginda was but a toddler when the French packed up and left. He grew up in the days of the Republic of Dahomey, a somewhat stable and functioning democracy which he was proud to be part of. However, as time went on, and the Republic continued to turn a blind eye to the increasingly furious Gbe people, the situation continued to deteriorate. As Babaginda joined the ranks of the generals, the frustrations boiled over into a bloodless military coup, expected to be led by the esteemed general Christophe Soglo. However, Soglo, along with multiple other senior generals, refused the position, leaving the President's seat open and dividing the army into two cliques- one for the coup and one against it. With nobody stepping up to the seat, the pro-coup clique nominated Babaginda to the seat which he reluctantly accepted, becoming President at the mere age of 20 in 1961. He would soon come to regret that choice.\n\nMuch adversity pushes the newfound Gbeland to the brink of destruction. The anti-coup clique, led by the renowned and popular Soglo, remains a major threat to Babaginda's controversial regime. Memories of Dahomey persist in the minds of the people outside of the Gbe, who do not take kindly to being second class to the Gbe. Babaginda's influence in the military is still rather weak, especially in comparison to Soglo's. Above it all, the Germans continue their constant and regular bombings, a regular grim reaper of the people and the economy. It seems that Gbeland may be doomed to an early death.\n\nHowever, despite this, nobody can deny the fire behind Babaginda's eyes. He is the president now, and he will do everything to remain the President of Gbeland as long as he breathes, or die trying.
