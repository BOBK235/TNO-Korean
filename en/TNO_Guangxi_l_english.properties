POLITICS_XIA_WEI_DESC코0=Very few, if any, enjoy working for Xia Wei. The Japanese aren't quite sure how he got there, but they're concerned about disturbing the balance. Somehow, Xia gets away with blatantly criticizing for its treatment of China, after completing a years long purge of Japanese officials. \n\nEven with these supposed anti-Japanese views, the economy continues to be dominated by Zaibatus, and Xia's treasury seems to grow every time a new Japanese business opens up in growing Hechi. Xia, a longstanding Kuomintang official in Southern China, was, according to early unreliable Japanese reports, given Guangxi for his betrayal in the last days of the war to the Japanese side, even if he does not even try to hide his nationalist tendencies. Perhaps his more-republican-then-thou mentality will come into use eventually. For now, it's just an irritation for Japanese officials in the region.
