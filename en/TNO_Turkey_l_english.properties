TUR_THENEWORDER_DESC코0=When the German traitors sealed off the Dardanelles with their dam, it not only ruined our economy, but any good will we had previously had towards Germany. While we have tried our utmost to industrialize our nation and subsidies our farmers, it has simply not been able to halt the continual economic downturn that we currently face. The Turkish Land Forces are the pride of our great nation, and the only thing preventing a coup and instability for Turkey.

##Leader Bios##

POLITICS_ALPARSLAN_TURKES_DESC코0=If anyone embodies the new Turkey, it is Alparslan Türkeş, the Başbuğ. Born as Hüseyin Feyzullah into a Turkish family in Nicosia, he changed his name to Alparslan Türkeş, and emigrated alongside them in the 1930s to a not-so-foreign nation just to the north: the Republic of Turkey. Volunteering to serve in his nation's military in 1938, he quickly became involved with Turkey's fascist groups, many of which were more than willing to serve in their great nation's military. However, Türkeş felt that Turkey had to be made a better nation for the Turks, and that he would be the one to do so.\n\nThe opportunity for Türkeş came in 1942. Frustrated by president İnönü's inaction in the war, he, with other right-wing officers, seized control of the country in a coup. Now, Colonel Türkeş was in power, and prepared to chart a new course for the Turkish state. Joining the Axis forces, Turkish troops fought in the east, occupying the Caucasus. However, as the war ended, Germany took Azerbaijan - not only an oil-rich area, but also populated by Turkic Azerbaijanis - and part of Georgia. With the failure to  obtain Azerbaijan, things began to go downhill for the Başbuğ.\n\nThe effects of Türkeş' insistence on running the economy himself had already started to show, but, with the draining of the Mediterranean, the state of things truly became apparent, as Turkey's economy went into free-fall. In order to hold on to power after the crash, Türkeş had to find ways to boost his popularity. So, he doubled down on the rhetoric of expansionism, nationalism and pan-Turkic unity, with the Italian territories in the south entering his sights. Now, as Turkey's alliance with its fellow Mediterranean powers deteriorates, the time of peace may not last much longer, and the drums of war will once again beat in the Middle East.

turkey.921.t코0=A Valley of Wolves
turkey.921.d코0=The Republic of Turkey, lying between Asia and Europe, is a land of wonders. A long time has passed since the age of Sultans and Caliphs was ended, and the Republic was declared by Mustafa Kemal Paşa, later known as Atatürk. His legacy was not to last, as when war broke out in Eastern Europe, the young Colonel Alparslan Türkeş rallied fascist elements within Turkey and overthrew İsmet İnönü and the Kemalist republic. Shortly thereafter, Türkeş declared himself the Başbuğ or Leader of Turkey - modelling his regime off of his newfound German ally - and joined the war against the Soviet Union. Claiming the valuable, and of course, rightfully Turkish lands of Azerbaijan, Türkeş was looking forward to cementing his absolute rule over Turkey through his conquests, but alas, this too was not meant to be.\n\n The territories that Turkey had hoped to take for its own were instead given over to the newly formed Reichskommissariat Kaukasia, but this was not even the beginning of the wretched German treachery - in a bout of utter stupidity, Hitler decided to follow through with the German Atlantropa Project, draining the Mediterranean and leaving Turkey a broken nation, it's ports dried up and climate forever changed. With their internal divisions growing ever larger, and a shattered economy, Turkey joined the newly formed Triumvirate under the leadership of Italy in an effort to stave off both their own internal issues and any possible German aggression. That was almost ten years ago, and much has changed in the meantime. With Turkish ambition growing, time shall tell if this Triumvirate shall last...
turkey.921.a코0=Turkey's fate is its own.

turkey.2.t코0=The German Moon Landing
turkey.2.d코0=After a long day of inspecting the Grey Wolves, Başbuğ Alparslan Türkeş decided to retire to his study in Çankaya Mansion. After taking off his shoes, stepping over the Turkmen silk carpet lying on the wooden floor of the room and collapsing into his chair in tiredness, the Başbuğ asked the nanny who brought his evening coffee to turn on the television before leaving. The television showed an image that was almost surreal, and it took a good 30 seconds for the Başbuğ to fully understand what it meant. "Allah kahretsin!" he yelled as he threw his cup of coffee to the floor in anger. Now, both his carpet and his evening were ruined.\n\nThe broadcast of a German raumonaut saluting to the Nazi flag on the Moon was watched by all of the nation. Turkey was never a contender in the space race, as Turkey's space program is little more than an underfunded department under ROKETSAN. Such things do not matter to Turkey on the whole, however - the most impact it had was on the underground betting industry of Istanbul; many men had become rich that night off their unlikely bets on a German victory in the space race over America and Japan.
