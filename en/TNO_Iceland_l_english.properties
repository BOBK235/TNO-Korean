ICE_growing_unpopularity코0=Growing Unpopularity
ICE_growing_unpopularity_desc코0=When Iceland was first occupied, back in 1940, it was already somewhat unpopular with the native Icelanders. However, the promise of freedom once the war ended kept them sated and content. What these Icelanders didn't know is that the freedom would only come if the Allies were victorious.\n\nNow, it has been over 20 years since the end of the second Great War, and America remains in Iceland. The people of Iceland are tired of being under the thumb of the so called "defenders of liberty", and the USFI now struggles to keep calm and order. With Iceland being a major part of the States' military plans regarding Germany, the Icelandic people protesting and rioting for their independence regularly, neither side willing to back down, and elections looming closer and closer, it seems that tensions may finally boil over. Only god knows what will happen after that.
ICE_castle_island코0=Castle Island
ICE_castle_island_desc코0=Iceland has been turned into a fortress of the Atlantic by the US military. Naval bases dot the coasts, thousands of soldiers patrol a dozen bases, and planes regularly soar from the many airfields. In addition, forts and guns dot the countryside, becoming a regular sight. Though the people of Iceland protest this heavy militarization of their homeland, there is no doubt that Iceland is an integral part of any plan into Europe, from surveillance and spying to possible invasion. Not only is the island necessary for offense, but it would also serve as the first line of defense against a German invasion, choking trade, securing nearby waters from the dreaded wolfpacks of the Kriegsmarine, and obliterating any enemy who tries to land on the shores. With the sheer amount of time, money, and planning invested into Iceland, the loss of the island would be a serious setback for any action, offensive or defensive, against the Nazi menace.
