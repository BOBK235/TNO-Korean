POLITICS_MASANOBU_TSUJI_DESC코0=Tsuji's past is shrouded in myth, created by the terror surrounding the man. Depending on who you ask, he was either the slaughterer of hundreds of thousands or the general who won the war through unorthodox means. \n\nTo the peasent, he's a man who ignored due process and executed anyone suspecting of taking part in the resistance. To the discharged army man, he's an insane general who threw human waves at a resolute army. To the current army man, there is no one else they would serve under, in his infinite benevolence and strangeness. \n\nThe hearsay dictates that he was indeed responsible in large part for certain military operations, and went on to serve in some particular instituitions and organizations in the Japanese apparatus. The psychologist would say that Tsuji had a greed for power, and needed to elevate himself to a seat on the Imperial Diet. The loyalist would say that Tsuji had great plans for Japan, and it was only the Chinese collaborators and communists that compromised his plan and forced him to lose his election. The traditionalist would say the emperor personally exiled Tsuji for the rumors across the empire. The Pan-Asianist would say that they heard he walked through Manchukuo and Mengjiang, taking his time to tour the glory of the empire on his way to his new appointment. \n\nThe Muslim would say that he came to the west to torture the Prophet's Followers and put Ma Bufang to the stake. Tsuji would say that he was simply serving his duty. The western observer would watch and say that there must be an end to the conflict in the northwest soon, while the local would say that the torment of the iron hand never seems to fade. To all, however, one thing is in agreement; The Mad General prepares for war.

HUI_THENEWORDER_DESC코0=The Hui Autonomous region was one of the last Northern Governorates to join with Japan, Governor General Ma Hongbin favouring to save his soldiers and people from slaughter. His reward was an enlarged region, plenty of funds, and tasked with keeping order over West China. Nine years later the complacent Hongbin would be assassinated by his own son Ma Dunjing in 1955, kicking off an insurrection against those that remained loyal to Japan. The arrival of a special Japanese task force under General Masanobu Tsuji would serve as the downfall of the insurrection, with it finally petering out by 1960. Japan has seen fit, with Nanjing's tacit consent, to put Tsuji in as a temporary governor while order is restored to Western China.

hui.1.t코0=Dawn Raid
hui.1.d코0=Ningxia looms large over Northwest China. Ever since General Tsuji took charge of the Japanese puppet, life has been constant fear for the peasants, as his bandit armies sacked China. Today, this fear was justified. General Tsuji's troops rode into a village shortly before dawn. Tsuji personally called the village to the central square, where an unspeakable cruelty was committed. Tsuji's troops laughed through the whole ordeal. They smiled and joked and killed through the sobs of mothers, the cries of infants, and the pleading of fathers. As the stench of death hung in the air, the soldiers went through the town. The bitter irony is that the town lacked any sort of treasure for these bandits. Still, they took anything resembling valuables - family heirlooms, picture frames, even old furniture.
hui.1.a코0=The depths of our evil...
