### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JOZEF_TISO_DESC코0=The entire life of Dr. Jozef Tiso, Cleric, a Roman Catholic priest, and President of the First Slovak Republic, has been an unparalleled success. From early strides in his education to ordainment in the Catholic Church as a priest, and then a successful career as a moderate politician. It seemed that Tiso was a beacon of hope, a decent and good human being. Yet, by the middle of the 1930s, Tiso's views had shifted toward authoritarian and totalitarian ideas, he had become a radical figure in Slovak politics. Then, when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, Dr. Jozef Tiso was appointed President of the First Slovak Republic. Tiso betrayed his own people, buying into the 'Führer-cult'.\n\nAfter the Axis' resounding victory in the Second World War, Europe prospered for a short time, then came the decade of unrest. The Slovak economy, brought down by the German economic crash, had been all but annihilated. Yet, the Slovak government prevailed. In response to increased unrest in the nation, President Tiso introduced further repression against his own people as a mean of silencing all discontent.\n\nBy 1962, President Tiso's health has rapidly declined and shows no sign of improvement. As Tiso's health worsens, many concerned parties within the government have begun to prepare for the incoming event of his passing.
POLITICS_STEFAN_TISO_DESC코0=Placeholder
POLITICS_JAN_GOLIAN_DESC코0=Placeholder
POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_FOERTSCH_DESC코0=Friedrich Albert Foertsch, a son of Franconian farmers, has been committed to the German nationalist ideas even since he volunteered to serve in the Imperial German Army during WWI and later joined the Freikorps during the turbulent period of 1920 to combat the Bolshevik threat. Unwanted by the Weimar Republic, Foertsch again found his place in the military after Hitler's rise to power and built his career from a major to a general on the battlefields of France and the Soviet Union. A staunch believer in the might of the German war machine, Foersch wisely chose to side with Hermann Göring during the power struggle that happened after Hitler's death, securing his position in the Wehrmacht after the end of the civil war.\n\nFor his faithful service to the Fatherland and his closeness to the new Führer, Foertsch was granted with the territories of the Reichskommissariat Slowakei to govern it as its sole ruler. The previous native government proved itself to be incapable for responsible and competent reigning over their own kin and thus it became necessary to establish a stronger German presence to keep the rebellious Slovak population in line with the National Socialist directive and to keep their pathetic state useful for the Reich. Pacifying the disloyal populace and strengthening the German grip over those lands is a heavy task, but isn't one that a venerable Wehrmacht general can't handle.

### Ideas ###
SLO_tiso_dead코0=Death of Tiso
SLO_tiso_dead_desc코0=With Tiso's death the country has been thrown into chaos. The goverment is compleatly paralyzed and the people, starting to realise this, are demanding change. We must act fast to stop any further instability.
SLO_Chained_Minds코0=Chained Minds
SLO_Chained_Minds_desc코0=To nobody's wonder, free expression of opinion isn't allowed in Slovakia. While some may argue that free speech is undermining goverment stability, and thus it's disallowance is fundamental to a functioning state, people aren't very happy about it, as aren't the thinkers.
SLO_Political_Tensions코0=Political Tensions
SLO_Political_Tensions_desc코0=While Tiso has been our undisputed leader for over 20 years, his health has been declining, as it always does. This, of course, means that everyone involved in Slovakian politics have started vying for power, in all forms possible. And if it wasn't enough, reports about zero resistance activity are appearing to be false...
SLO_Agitated_Workers코0=Agitated Workers
SLO_Agitated_Workers_desc코0=While the Republic has been doing quite fine the past few decades, problems still haunt her, such as the workers. Be it low wages, poor working conditions, or just a general disagreement with the goverment, the workers are on constant strikes.
SLO_Uncompetitive_Economy코0=Uncompetitive Economy
SLO_Uncompetitive_Economy_desc코0=Fascism, as it would appear, has not been the kindest to our economy. This should be resolved, if we are to not suffer a complete economic breakdown.
SLO_Social_Liberalization코0=The Slovak Voice
SLO_Social_Liberalization_desc코0=
SLO_Political_Liberalization코0=A Free Slovakia?

Rejoin the Pakt, and be allowed to stay in power.
