APC_1970_advanced_turret_desc코0=The turret adorning the armored personnel carrier is only as effective as the man behind it, and if he dies, the turret is useless. Improving supportive defenses for the turret will allow greater survivability rates for machine gunners for the carriers.

# 1980
APC_1980_basic_turret코0=Armament Missile Introduction
APC_1980_basic_turret_desc코0=With the coming of the modern age comes the improvement of explosive weaponry in military use, and our armored personnel carriers could benefit. Attaching missile capabilities to these vehicles could prove exponentially deadly on the battlefield.
APC_1980_improved_turret코0=Computerized Offensive Controls
APC_1980_improved_turret_desc코0=The deadliness of a turret atop an armored personnel carrier can increase twofold when electronically connected to the capabilities of a second. Therefore, implementing computerized communication systems for machine gunners could prove greatly effective.
APC_1980_advanced_turret코0=Sustained Offensive Improvements
APC_1980_advanced_turret_desc코0=After years of development, the offensive capabilities of the armored personnel carrier has reached its true potential. Offering sustained, communicated, explosive firepower against our enemies will allow for the ultimate protection of our infantrymen in the battles of the world.

# 1950
IFV_1950_basic_armor코0=Open-Topped IFVs
IFV_1950_basic_armor_desc코0=Early IFV technologies held little real protection for infantrymen being transported. Often, hatches were non-existent and IFV's held no protection against chemical, nuclear, or biological destruction. Soldiers were exposed to the open air.
IFV_1950_improved_armor코0=WMD Protection
IFV_1950_improved_armor_desc코0=Adding hatches and sealing the inside of the IFV, as well as providing clean ventilation, allowed for troops to have effective protection against chemical weapons and, in the case of a nuclear war, radiation. These early WMD protection systems made IFVs far safer.
IFV_1950_advanced_armor코0=NBC Protection Innovations
IFV_1950_advanced_armor_desc코0=Advances in ventilation technology as well as the innovation of providing filtered air meant troops could fight and move in even the worst conditions. Advancing upon previous technologies greatly increased protection.

# 1960
IFV_1960_basic_armor코0=Frontal Arc Armor Innovation
IFV_1960_basic_armor_desc코0=Increased armor on the front sheets of the IFV finally achieved one of the key goals of any effective IFV; real protection from large caliber rifles. Advancing IFVs could now safely move towards enemy fire without sustaining damage to the vehicle. 
IFV_1960_improved_armor코0=Modernized Internal Structure
IFV_1960_improved_armor_desc코0=Using new alloys and synthetic materials in the interior of IFVs provided greater protection to infantry in the IFV. Even if bullets penetrated the first layer, shrapnel would be stopped on the wall of the interior.
IFV_1960_advanced_armor코0=Composite Armor
IFV_1960_advanced_armor_desc코0=Layering different ceramics, metals, and plastics atop one another isn't just cheaper then a single steel body - it provides unparalleled protection, deflecting bullets and allowing nothing to penetrate farther then a few inches. Adopting these composite armor developments is revolutionary in IFV design.

# 1970
IFV_1970_basic_armor코0=Reorganized Blueprint
IFV_1970_basic_armor_desc코0=Increased efficiency and reforms in blueprint design allow for faster mass production and the development of more exact armor measurements. This decreases production costs and increases protection.
IFV_1970_improved_armor코0=Hull Floor Reinforcement
IFV_1970_improved_armor_desc코0=Increasing hull thickness at the hull while using cheaper and lighter metals means that mines no longer will be a death sentence for the IFV and the infantrymen inside. It will also provide protection against any other explosives and allows for a far more stable ride. 
IFV_1970_advanced_armor코0=Aluminum Alloy Hull
IFV_1970_advanced_armor_desc코0=The use of not just aluminum, but complex aluminum alloys, allows for far lighter IFVs. These hulls would become present in most IFVs and fighting vehicles of the time. 

# 1980
IFV_1980_basic_armor코0=Reactive Armor
IFV_1980_basic_armor_desc코0=Reactive armor systems increase deflection of both large and small arms, while providing greater resistance to explosions, making it an all around good option. With the development of complex reactive armor, many armor systems integrated this into tanks and IFVs designed for close combat and work on the front lines.
IFV_1980_improved_armor코0=Explosive Resistance System
IFV_1980_improved_armor_desc코0=Explosive reactive armor has been successfully implemented on tanks in the past, and has dramatically increased their survivability against penetrator rounds, shaped charges, and other armor-piercing weapons. We should do the same for our IFVs.
IFV_1980_advanced_armor코0=Active Protection System
IFV_1980_advanced_armor_desc코0=As guided anti-tank missiles become more advanced, so too must the systems that defend against them. Electronic countermeasures, radar chaff and counter-rockets or other missile interceptors can keep our tanks safe from even the deadliest projectiles.

# 1950
IFV_1950_basic_turret코0=IFV 20mm Autocannon
IFV_1950_basic_turret_desc코0=The 20mm autocannon is the standard of IFVs worldwide, something to give the vehicle more firepower than an APC whilst remaining understanding that it is not supposed to be in the direct line of fire in most circumstances. 
IFV_1950_improved_turret코0=Firing Ports
IFV_1950_improved_turret_desc코0=One of the main advantages of an IFV is that infantry are not rendered unable to engage in combat whilst traveling. With firing ports and IFV can engage an assailant with its troop complement and not just the arms of the vehicle itself.
IFV_1950_advanced_turret코0=Improved Cannon Rotation
IFV_1950_advanced_turret_desc코0=Cannon rotation is important for a vehicle expected to fight on the move, and will give the IFV greatly increased capabilities for engaging hostile forces. However this does not mean it should do so outside exceptional circumstances.

# 1960
IFV_1960_basic_turret코0=IFV 73mm Autocannon
IFV_1960_basic_turret_desc코0=Whilst most IFV's retain the standard 20mm armament there is room for specific models to have greatly increased firepower depending upon their desired role. Additionally, this will assist in fighting entrenched enemy positions.
IFV_1960_improved_turret코0=Co-axial Machine Guns
IFV_1960_improved_turret_desc코0=Machine guns are an important part of the armament of an IFV, and their placement is important so as to provide the widest firing arc possible. Suppression is an under appreciated factor of warfare upon occasion.
IFV_1960_advanced_turret코0=Enclosed Firing Ports
IFV_1960_advanced_turret_desc코0=An improvement to firing ports is to give the infantrymen using them better protection. It is, after all, best if an IFV can get its entire complement to the fight as opposed to losing a man needlessly.

# 1970
IFV_1970_basic_turret코0=Anti-Tank Capabilities
IFV_1970_basic_turret_desc코0=The tank is a significant threat to any IFV, but they may be more wary if the IFV has some teeth of its own. No IFV should seek an engagement with armor of course, but circumstances sometimes demand difficult decisions.
IFV_1970_improved_turret코0=Improved Armament Setups
IFV_1970_improved_turret_desc코0=One of the more important factors of any IFV design is its actual weapon setup. The main gun needs to be capable of effectively engaging foes, as well as being a moderated support weapon arrangement for additional combat firepower.
IFV_1970_advanced_turret코0=90mm Cannon
IFV_1970_advanced_turret_desc코0=Whilst an IFV might not be exactly designed for sustained combat, it should not be helpless. A 90mm cannon works wonders against vehicles, perhaps moreso on soldiers.

# 1980
IFV_1980_basic_turret코0=Two Man Guns
IFV_1980_basic_turret_desc코0=A two man cannon is arguably superior to a one man design, as it removes some of the vulnerabilities associated with one man being knocked out in combat or being distracted doing two things at once.
IFV_1980_improved_turret코0=More Firing Ports
IFV_1980_improved_turret_desc코0=Increasing the number of firing ports will allow to troops to return fire from the safety of the IFV, even when they are engaged while moving or unable to exit the vehicle.
IFV_1980_advanced_turret코0=Anti-Tank Missiles
IFV_1980_advanced_turret_desc코0=The next logical step in increasing the fighting capabilities of our IFVs is mounting them with anti-tank missiles. This will allow them to engage heavier armor with moderate success.

# 1950
MBT_1950_basic_armor코0=Rudimentary Composite Ceramics
MBT_1950_basic_armor_desc코0=It has been demonstrated that a thin layer of enamel will improve the ballistic properties of steel. We should test this out and begin looking for ways to expand on this concept.
MBT_1950_improved_armor코0=Siliceous-Cored Armor
MBT_1950_improved_armor_desc코0=Putting a piece of fused silica glass between two rolled steel plates almost doubles the armor effectiveness of the steel plates. This will help our tanks shrug off enemy fire much easier.
MBT_1950_advanced_armor코0=Combination K Ceramic Type
MBT_1950_advanced_armor_desc코0=Instead of glass, our experiments have found a layer of plastic reinforced by glass and ceramic plates works much better. We can defend against HEAT rounds and shaped charges better without sacrificing defense against kinetic energy penetrators.

# 1960
MBT_1960_basic_armor코0=Multi-layered Steel-Ceramic Composite
MBT_1960_basic_armor_desc코0=By incorporating many spaced layers of hardened steel with layers of boron carbide composite, the effectiveness of our armor plate becomes enormously greater, as the projectile shatters as it travels through the different materials.
MBT_1960_improved_armor코0=Advanced Armor Skirts
MBT_1960_improved_armor_desc코0=By placing strong armor composites on the outside of the tank hull, spaced just a few inches from the main armor, we can radically increase its effectiveness, as the spaced armor causes shaped-charge projectiles to shatter and explode before they can strike the main plate.
MBT_1960_advanced_armor코0=Prototype Reactive Armor
MBT_1960_advanced_armor_desc코0=We can equip our tanks with additional armor composed high explosive sandwiched in between composite metallic-ceramic plating, which, when struck by an armor-piercing round, should explode and shatter the projectile, greatly decreasing its damaging potential, if not negating it entirely. However, this armor is could prove expensive and unreliable.

# 1970
MBT_1970_basic_armor코0=Improved Ceramic Compounds
MBT_1970_basic_armor_desc코0=More research into ceramic technology has given us a number of interesting possibilities. We now have many new combinations of materials to stick between our steel plates.
MBT_1970_improved_armor코0=Boron-Carbide Aggregate
MBT_1970_improved_armor_desc코0=Boron-Carbide is one of the hardest known materials out there, and attempts must be to made into integrate it into the armor of our vehicles. We will put it in between the steel plates to make a hard composite armor.
MBT_1970_advanced_armor코0=Chobham Armor
MBT_1970_advanced_armor_desc코0=Ceramic plating may provide more protection than the current materials. An improved version of the early ceramic prototypes is now being produced, and it gives us better protection against HEAT shells than anything else out there.

# 1980
MBT_1980_basic_armor코0=Depleted Uranium Composites
MBT_1980_basic_armor_desc코0=Depleted Uranium, a by-product of uranium enrichment, can be incorporated into some of the layers of already established composites. Due to its high density, it can shatter the projectile more effectively than standard composites.
MBT_1980_improved_armor코0=Advanced Explosive Reactive Armor
MBT_1980_improved_armor_desc코0=More advanced and more sensitive high explosives can be incorporated into our reactive armor plates, allowing them to more effectively destroy incoming projectiles before they damage their targets.
MBT_1980_advanced_armor코0=Non-Energetic Reactive Armor
MBT_1980_advanced_armor_desc코0=Instead of using high explosives sandwiched in-between armor plates, we could use a porous material like rubber. When struck by a shaped charge warhead, the warhead's energy causes a dramatic increase in pressure and counter-explosion in the rubber, destroying the warhead. While slightly less effective, it is much safer and lighter than the explosive variety.

# 1950
MBT_1950_basic_turret코0=Early Auto-loaders
MBT_1950_basic_turret_desc코0=Mechanical aids for our tank crews can facilitate loading and extraction of tank shells, reducing the tasks necessary to operate a tank in the middle of combat.
MBT_1950_improved_turret코0=HEAT Integration
MBT_1950_improved_turret_desc코0=A High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warhead relies on a shaped charge to punch through enemy armor and send a molten stream of it into the vehicle, messing it up. It should be the primary anti-armor round used by our main battle tanks.
MBT_1950_advanced_turret코0=APFSDS
MBT_1950_advanced_turret_desc코0=Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) rounds will give our tanks heavier striking power against modern armor systems, by adding fins to increase the stability and range of traditional Sabot shells.

# 1960
MBT_1960_basic_turret코0=Mechanical Ballistic Computer
MBT_1960_basic_turret_desc코0=We can introduce a very basic sort of computer that will allow our gunners to hit more accurately in adverse conditions, such as strong winds.
MBT_1960_improved_turret코0=Turret Range Finders
MBT_1960_improved_turret_desc코0=By placing automatic range finders into a gunner's sight, we allow the exact measurement of distance to a particular target, allowing for more precise, longer range hits.
MBT_1960_advanced_turret코0=Advanced Cannon Stabilization
MBT_1960_advanced_turret_desc코0=By implementing a complex series of shock absorbers and hydraulics throughout the tank, we can improve the stabilization of the gun to such a degree that it will be able to fire accurately even when moving.

# 1970
MBT_1970_basic_turret코0=AOS
MBT_1970_basic_turret_desc코0=Add-on stabilization mechanisms allow the tank to have greater accuracy while firing, improving the effectiveness of the vehicle while at speed. This will improve our existing guns immensely.
MBT_1970_improved_turret코0=Depleted Uranium Munitions
MBT_1970_improved_turret_desc코0=Enemy tanks are getting harder to penetrate, so we use harder weaponry. After much research, our scientists have decided that depleted uranium shells will allow us to breech enemy armor most effectively.
MBT_1970_advanced_turret코0=IR Detector and Night Vision
MBT_1970_advanced_turret_desc코0=Installing infrared and night vision systems on our tanks allow our tank crews to see more, avoiding ambushes and camouflage, and allowing our tanks to operate more effectively at night.

# 1980
MBT_1980_basic_turret코0=Fire-Control Computer
MBT_1980_basic_turret_desc코0=The introduction of integrated fire-control electronics within our turrets will increase sight effectiveness by a high margin. Our systems are capable of producing all the figures a gunner needs in mere seconds, delivering a quick and accurate firing solution.
MBT_1980_improved_turret코0=Thermal Coating
MBT_1980_improved_turret_desc코0=Using an advanced thermal shielding on the interior of the turrets barrel should reduce the level of deformation that occurs from high temperatures. This advancement will allow a greater fire rate within our tank, as the heat becomes more thoroughly managed.
MBT_1980_advanced_turret코0=Anti-tank Laser-guided Missiles
MBT_1980_advanced_turret_desc코0=Gun launched guided missiles will give our gunners a degree of flexibility that is much needed within tank battles. These missiles can be hand guided right into enemy armor, with a considerable amount of flight time.

tactical_support_desc코0=Infantry forces cannot operate alone! In those precious moments, when lives are on the line, tactical support makes the difference, be it softening a hard target or coordinating evacuations.\n\n

artillery_barrage코0=Artillery Barrage
artillery_barrage_desc코0=Artillery has existed in some form for hundreds of years, and continues to be relevant today. A good artillery barrage saves the lives of many infantrymen, instilling fear in enemy lines and disrupting their operations. There are many new innovations to be made in this field.\n\n
preemptive_strike코0=Preemptive Strike
preemptive_strike_desc코0=The best defense is always a good offense. Why should we wait in hiding-holes for the enemy to confront or even maneuver around us when we could be taking the fight to them. By hitting them before they are prepared for battle we are able to fight on our own terms.\n\n

organic_units코0=Organic Units
organic_units_desc코0=While broader tactical support is an important part of our doctrine, so too are organic units. In the interest of response time and cohesion, we will allow each branch to create specialized support forces. With any luck, they will fulfill roles of their rival branches while remaining embedded within their own.

land_navy_coordination코0=Land-Naval Coordination
land_navy_coordination_desc코0=Land-Naval Coordination is vital to amphibious operations. From transport to supporting fire, our ships are a powerful tool in the hands of our infantry. We will build upon this relationship.\n\n
marine_elite코0=Elite Marines
marine_elite_desc코0=Dedicated Marine units are vital to the modern battlefield. Trained to carry out a variety of expeditionary operations, amphibious or otherwise, they pick up the slack left by other armed forces. Our marines will be dutiful, competent, and ready for asymmetrical warfare.\n\n
commando_landing_operations코0=Commando Landing Operations
commando_landing_operations_desc코0=By using reliable and covert insertion methods, we can deploy our elite commando units behind the enemy lines to wreak havoc upon their organization, morale, and supply lines. These tactics are specially effective in reducing the effectiveness of enemy forces in preparation for larger operations\n\n

airland_strikes코0=Air-Land Strikes
airland_strikes_desc코0=By providing our ground forces with the enhanced ability to directly request air strikes and support from attack aircraft, the accuracy, deadliness, and speed of our air-land strikes will be greatly improved.\n\n
vertical_envelopement코0=Vertical Envelopment
vertical_envelopement_desc코0=Aerial insertion of infantry near the battlefield has the potential to greatly increase the speed and unpredictability of our land forces. By either air-dropping or air-lifting troops behind the front line we can rapidly encircle and cut off large enemy formations. Our army and air force will work in unison to strike the enemy from every direction.\n\n
air_ground_task_forces코0=Air-Ground Task Forces
air_ground_task_forces_desc코0=Merged so to act in unison, combat elements from different fields of battle - army, artillery, airspace - can quickly respond to and counter enemy offensives as they appear. The counteroffensives they deliver hence will deliver swift, decisive victory.\n\n

## Maneuver Warfare
maneuver_warfare코0=Maneuver Warfare
maneuver_warfare_desc코0=Maneuver warfare may be an obselescent doctrine, but its core principles are still useful today. By adding modern day tactics, we can easily reapply the strategy that had once guided the Reich to victory.\n\n

schwerpunkt_tactics코0=Schwerpunkt Tactics
schwerpunkt_tactics_desc코0=Schwerpunkt - "focal point" in German - refers to the strategy of concentrating an attack onto one portion of an enemy's defensive line. The tactic is intended to break through this portion and quickly spread into the rear of an enemy's line. By training our forces with this philosophy in mind, we shall take the first step to a Blitzkrieg of our own.\n\n
spearpoints코0=Spearpoints
spearpoints_desc코0=The idea of Schwerpunkt must be drilled not just into our men, but into our generals too. We must make sure that all of our forces are ready, willing, and able to perform offensives at a moment's notice if the doctrine is to work as intended.\n\n

massive_bombardment코0=Massive Bombardment
massive_bombardment_desc코0=The Schwerpunkt is certainly a strong tactic, but much of it rests on the assumption that the initial attack succeeds. To maximize our chances, we must make sure that any section we attack is first pummeled by artillery and aircraft alike. In a perfect scenario, our forces will stroll over what remains of their lines without a single causality.\n\n
overwhelming_strikes코0=Overwhelming Strikes
overwhelming_strikes_desc코0=Our attacks must be absolute in their power and force. We cannot afford to hold reserves or be cautious about our Schwerpunkt - total success or total defeat rides on the piercing blow. We must train our troops to move from place to place quickly in order to organize as many massive strikes as possible.\n\n

combined_blitz코0=Combined Blitz
combined_blitz_desc코0=A Schwerpunkt attack with only armor is suicidal. A Schwerpunkt attack with only infantry is doubly so. But combined, along with air support, these form into an nigh-unstoppable force. It is of the utmost importance that we improve coordination between all wings of our armed forces.\n\n

adaptive_command_training코0=Adaptive Command Training
adaptive_command_training_desc코0=The tides of war can be as unpredictable as those of a stormy sea, and we must train our officers to account for this reality. Soon not even surprise and circumstance are acceptable excuses.\n\n
mission_type_tactics코0=Mission-Type Tactics
mission_type_tactics_desc코0=While we cannot always expect our officers to predict the circumstances of combat, we can train them in every scenario we can think of. The more familiar they become with the situations they are likely to encounter, the better our officers will be able to confront our enemies in a more efficient fashion.\n\n
military_deception코0=Military Deception
military_deception_desc코0=Part of the problem of adopting a strategy used to win the biggest war in history is that tactics are developed to counter it. Our enemies are doubtless ready to rush reinforcements to wherever we attack - therefore, we shall use feints to trick them into sending their forces away from the true battle.\n\n

assault_concentration코0=Assault Concentration
assault_concentration_desc코0=Our officers shall conduct en masse attacks as resources and war's fortunes permit. They may be adepts in fighting equal or superior forces, but they are savants in fighting with the deck stacked in their favor.\n\n
strategic_depth_exploitation코0=Strategic Depth Exploitation
strategic_depth_exploitation_desc코0=We will strive to keep a significant distance between our front lines and the vulnerable home front. The use of depots and armories along the routes and airports for transportation will ensure that we are able to attack and defend without worrying about throwing our defenses into disarray.\n\n
supply_chain_extension코0=Supply-Chain Extension
supply_chain_extension_desc코0=Fighting deep into enemy territory is often required of the mobile modern army, likewise leaving them vulnerable to supply shortages and encirclement. We will train our generals to extend their supply lines through the use of rear echelon forces and garrisons that can secure the roads from home.\n\n

shock_and_awe코0=Shock And Awe
shock_and_awe_desc코0=Even a well-prepared enemy can be thrown off of their footing by an impressive enough display of firepower and force. By leveraging massed artillery fire, coordinated air strikes, and overwhelming numbers at the point of contact any enemy can be crushed.\n\n

## Strategic Theorem
strategic_theorem코0=Strategic Theorem
strategic_theorem_desc코0=Wars are unglamorous, but there is beauty in seeing well-planned, well-timed and well-performed operations unfold in real time. Our generals shall prioritize perfecting this art.\n\n

prepared_defense코0=Prepared Redoubt Systems
prepared_defense_desc코0=Small, well-fortified redoubts will serve as early warning systems against incoming enemy attacks. If positioned at certain strategic positions, these redoubts can delay offensives for hours and even days.\n\n
army_reserve_training코0=Army Reserve Training
army_reserve_training_desc코0=Guns, tanks and planes only perform as well as the men who man them. Take away the men, and even the most sophisticated weapon systems remain as inert and useless as scrap metal. A healthy reserve corps will preclude this scenario from occurring in our armies.\n\n
infrastructural_reserve코0=Infrastructural Reserve
infrastructural_reserve_desc코0=By maintaining a stockpile of construction materials, construction equipment and construction workers on hand, roads and factories damaged from air strikes or artillery fire will not have to wait long before returning to work as good as new.\n\n

operational_assault코0=Operational Assault
operational_assault_desc코0=An offensive attacks not only from the front, but also behind the adversary's lines and within their home fronts. A good general masters all three attacks to achieve unconditional victory.\n\n
large_front_operations코0=Large Front Operations
large_front_operations_desc코0=By striking the enemy at multiple points simultaneously along their entire front we can keep our foes on their backfoot and without the initiative. They dare not launch a counterattack for fear of being broken through down the line and they further have no ability to reinforce the points of contact as there are too many to handle even by the best led armies.\n\n
overwhelming_force코0=Overwhelming Force
overwhelming_force_desc코0=There is no point in fighting a battle you cannot be sure you will win. In modern warfare, the waste of equipment and manpower cannot be condoned. That is why, when we do attack, we do so with such a massed force as to sweep away any defensive that might be offered.\n\n

comprehensive_strategic_analysis코0=Comprehensive Strategic Analysis
comprehensive_strategic_analysis_desc코0=We need to train our staff officers to be able to grasp the strategic implication of every on-ground decision, and to be able to see the big picture as well as the small. Far too often an army is ruined by an inability to look beyond the tactical level. This will not happen to our forces, as our generals will have the skills needed to craft intelligent and successful operations.\n\n
large_scale_exercises코0=Large Scale Exercises
large_scale_exercises_desc코0=Individual recruit training is of course, a requirement for any professional army, but so too is strategic training. Using divisions, corps, and even entire armies we can simulate massive battlefields in which our generals will be able to learn the skills of directing troops and our soldiers will better learn to fight in their greater roles together.\n\n

supply_routes코0=Supply Chain Reinforcement
supply_routes_desc코0=Our use of large scale operations is contingent upon plentiful supply lines. It is therefore imperative that we adequately prepare them by using our engineers to rebuild infrastructure in occupied territories and using reserve forces as truck drivers and escorts wherever possible to ensure a steady line of supply reaches the front.\n\n
wartime_industry코0=Wartime Industry
wartime_industry_desc코0=Napoleon had learned that an army marches on his stomach; a century and a half later, the army's stomach has grown enough to necessitate a nation's worth of factories and workers. Ours shall step up to the task.\n\n

strategic_cycles코0=Strategic Cycles
strategic_cycles_desc코0=Always being on the offense will quickly wear out our forces, and always being on the defensive will ruin morale. We can make our strategic objectives easier to grasp and therefore easier to carry out by placing them into a cycle. We will attack along the line, hold to stabilize, and then attack after letting the enemy whittle themselves down uselessly.\n\n
concurrent_front_assaults코0=Concurrent Frontal Assaults
concurrent_front_assaults_desc코0=An enemy on the back foot, no matter how strong, can neither defend itself nor fight back. Our strategies shall hence make use of multiple units fighting concurrently to keep the enemy as often in the back foot as possible.\n\n

naval_doctrine_folder코0=Naval Doctrine
naval_doctrine_folder_desc코0=Naval doctrine, how our navy operates

### Blue Water Navy
blue_water_navy코0=Blue Water Navy
blue_water_navy_desc코0=How many nations can boast a fleet worthy of the high seas? A true modern superpower must be able to contest any point on the globe at any time with overwhelming force, mustering a force of battleships and carriers that would bankrupt a smaller nation. Gunboat diplomacy has never been so big.\n
global_fleet_distribution코0=Global Fleet Distribution
global_fleet_distribution_desc코0=To be able to maintain global hegemony, we must be within arm's reach of every continent. Our fleets will never tire in their patrol of the oceans, stationed at far-flung bases across the world.\n
the_hidden_arm코0=The Hidden Arm
the_hidden_arm_desc코0=A good navy has just as much tonnage beneath the waves as it does above it. The silent warfare beneath the surface is just as important as the noisy one above it - perhaps moreso, with the advent of the nuclear triad.\n
reserve_fleets코0=Reserve Fleets
reserve_fleets_desc코0=Fleets are ruinous to produce, and to replace one takes longer than most governments are in existence. We must maintain ships in reserve, to perform the roles of the those lost in combat or being repaired in drydock. Outlasting our enemy may be the key to starving them out.\n
global_range_operations코0=Global Range Operations
global_range_operations_desc코0=Maintaining enough forces to respond to a threat anywhere is impossible as much as we wish it we not. We must be able to operate on a global scale. If we have one fleet in the Atlantic and another in the Pacific we should be able to swap them without so much as a by-your-leave. Flexibility is the key to victory.\n
strike_groups코0=Strike Groups
strike_groups_desc코0=A captain is the king of his own vessel but our captains must know how to work together to achieve victory. Within each fleet our ships will be assigned to strike groups, working together with programmed efficiency to dismantle the enemy in detail \n
modern_kantai_kessen코0=Modern Kantai Kessen
modern_kantai_kessen_desc코0=The Kantai Kessen, or Decisive Battle Doctrine, is the strategy of eliminating the enemy navy in a quick, decisive battle, which the IJN used successfully in the last war. Though technology has changed, the rules of naval combat still apply, and we must prepare for this decisive moment.\n
undersea_coordination_tactics코0=Undersea Coordination Tactics
undersea_coordination_tactics_desc코0=Consider a game of Marco Polo, where every contestant has a knife. Then imagine that each player is at the bottom of the ocean with an extra dimension thrown in. We must produce procedures to ensure our captains act predictably in these situations, that they might work together without direct communication.\n
superior_screen_organization코0=Superior Screen Organization
superior_screen_organization_desc코0=Our capital ships may do all the damage but without their screens they are sitting ducks. If the destroyers that guard them move predictably a submarine can slip in a torpedo like a stiletto. Calculated formations for screening efficiency will ensure our flagships reach port safely.\n
heavy_missile_ship_focus코0=Heavy Missile Ship Focus
heavy_missile_ship_focus_desc코0=Missiles are the new planes - who needs a runway when death can be delivered in a can? Cruisers can punch above their weight by mounting heavy missiles instead of guns. No battleship is safe from these modern battle cruisers.\n
battle_groups코0=Battle Groups
battle_groups_desc코0=Consolidating our forces into task forces led by carriers will increase the lethality of our fleets. When we come upon the enemy, we will be able to destroy them easily with their superior firepower and air capabilities.\n
expanded_support_ship_roles코0=Expanded Support Ship Roles
expanded_support_ship_roles_desc코0=Support ships perform a vital role, fueling and supplying our ships and ferrying our servicemen, but what if they could do more? Radar and sonar, minesweeping equipment, depth charges, AA guns, missile defense systems. Every eventuality we can prepare for is a ship saved, and the support ships must do their part in protecting the fleet.\n
fleet_command_and_control코0=Fleet Command And Control
fleet_command_and_control_desc코0=Commanding a fleet of several dozen ships is no easy task, nor is it something to be left to one man. A redundant command structure will be needed if a fleet is to move as one unit rather than a mess of easily picked off lone wolves.
expanded_task_force_capabilities코0=Expanded Task Force Capabilities
expanded_task_force_capabilities_desc코0=A task force is only as capable as its weakest link, by fortifying the weaknesses of our naval forces we can enable them to, if not be entirely independent then at least function with autonomy most of the time.
bastions_on_the_sea코0=Bastions On The Sea
bastions_on_the_sea_desc코0=A ship is, in its own way a fortress upon the water. Its sailors cannot expect to get off it should the worst happen and this makes them fight until the last. In this age of strife it is the navy which shall protect the nation.

### Green Water Navy
green_water_navy코0=Green Water Navy
green_water_navy_desc코0=We may never have the ability to have a navy that can project power globally, but we can certainly have one that defends our waters with pride and honor. By focusing on the light ships of a navy, we can create a fleet that serves our purposes without bankrupting our economy.
coastal_submarine_patrols코0=Coastal Submarine Patrols
coastal_submarine_patrols_desc코0=The defense of our nation's waters do not only need to come from our surface fleet. By using submarines in our coastal patrols, we shall be able to defend our waters from smugglers and small craft, and pose enough of a deterrent to ward off attack from another nation.\n
destroyer_based_operations코0=Destroyer Based Operations
destroyer_based_operations_desc코0=Battleships and carriers may be economically impossible for us, but the small craft that make up the bulk of any navy are still available. The destroyers of our fleet shall take up the role of the cruiser in larger fleets: giving fire support, setting screens for our larger ships, and fighting with distinction in battle.\n
escort_frigate_groups코0=Escort Frigate Groups
escort_frigate_groups_desc코0=The frigate is crucial to the success of our navy, and as such we must bring a competent strategy to the table. Alone, the frigate is pitifully weak against any attacker, but when in groups, an escort can take on opponents of much greater armament. We must drill our captains relentlessly on group tactics and coordination if we wish for this strategy to succeed.\n
submarine_minelaying코0=Submarine Minelaying
submarine_minelaying_desc코0=Our navy will never be large enough to cover all of our coast at once, but we can use naval mines to cover our bases. In times of war, our submarines shall be able to deploy mines wherever needed to ward off enemies and destroy those foolish enough to sail into our waters.\n
reconnaisance_sweeping_tactics코0=Reconnaissance Sweeping Tactics
reconnaisance_sweeping_tactics_desc코0=An advantage that a lighter navy has over its larger counterparts is speed. Our destroyers, frigates, and submarines will patrol our waters on a regular basis, looking for enemies on a regular basis. Our speed will allow us to find the enemy, report his position, and retreat to reinforcements before they even have the chance to respond.\n
modern_screen_maneuvers코0=Modern Screen Maneuvers
modern_screen_maneuvers_desc코0=The screen maneuver has been used by light ships ever since the First World War, but naval warfare of today is much different than that of even 1945. We must train the captains of our lighter ships on the art of defending our heavier ships from aircraft, missiles, and anything else. After all, if we lose our big ships, we may never be able to repair them.\n
light_cruiser_doctrine코0=Light Cruiser Doctrine
light_cruiser_doctrine_desc코0=The light cruiser is the backbone of the green water navy- small enough to be quickly produced, fast enough to keep up with the rest of fleet, but armed well enough to fight against larger enemies. We must focus our doctrine around these craft if we wish to compete on the seas with anyone who could be an enemy.\n

# Headers / Section Titles

### Air Supremacy
air_supremacy코0=Global Force
air_supremacy_desc코0=To ensure control of any battlefield, our planes must be able to fight anywhere, strike anywhere, and give support anywhere we see fit. Our pilots will be trained to be ready at a moments notice, making sure we are capable of a rapid response.
overwhelming_support코0=Overwhelming Support
overwhelming_support_desc코0=An advantage in logistics and equipment will allow us to destroy enemy air superiority by sheer mass firepower. Via these new tactics, the skies will soon be our domain!
unending_coverage코0=Unending Coverage
unending_coverage_desc코0=Until recently there have been any number of issues which disrupt air coverage in times of war. Thankfully, the best of modern technology will allow us to implement round-the-clock refueling and support staff, and so keep our aces flying!
gunship_support코0=Gunship Support
gunship_support_desc코0=As air doctrine technology becomes more advanced, the helicopters which so effectively unleash devastation upon our enemies on the ground grow ever more separate from the planes that protect them. Thankfully, we now have the equipment to fix this.
maximized_silo_coverage코0=Maximized Silo Coverage
maximized_silo_coverage_desc코0=Thanks to newly developed targeting and anti-interception technology, our silo missiles will soon have an even broader range than ever before. Before long, there will be no plain, no tank, no enemy outside of our reach.
area_defense코0=Area Defense
area_defense_desc코0=Although historically applied only to the ground, the doctrine of "area defense" is increasingly being used in the air as well. Via new technology, we'll be able to keep our bombers over the enemy, and theirs safely crashing to the ground.
offensive_counter_air코0=Offensive Counter Air
offensive_counter_air_desc코0=Losing control of the air is close to ceding the battle. New offensive tactics will be employed, giving our air force teeth. We will seek out the planes of our enemies and send them back to the ground.
naval_helicopter_aviation코0=Naval Helicopter Aviation
naval_helicopter_aviation_desc코0=Although traditionally thought of as a land-based technology, helicopters have just as many applications at sea as on land, if not more. Our carriers can be more than simply floating runways - they can be floating helipads as well.
precision_bombardment코0=Precision Bombardment
precision_bombardment_desc코0=With the advent of precision-guided munitions, the old WWII-era paradigm has been turned on its head - instead of counting the number of sorties per target, we can now begin working to maximize the number of targets per sortie, drastically increasing the efficiency of air-to-ground operations.
air_tasking_order코0=Air Tasking Order
air_tasking_order_desc코0=The development of efficient air tasking - that is, the establishment of set target priorities - is a game-changer for operations planning. Ensuring that our communications network is capable of securely transmitting such orders in real time will grant us much better command and control.
high_altitude_bombing코0=High-Altitude Bombing
high_altitude_bombing_desc코0=Advancements in precision bombing have allowed us to conduct bombing missions at staggeringly high altitude. By taking advantage of this, the effectiveness of our strategic strikes will increase. With these changes, our bombing runs will be able to level even the most fortified target.
pop_up_attacks코0=Pop-Up Attacks
pop_up_attacks_desc코0=In the face of ever-advancing anti-aircraft weapons systems, our pilots must use tactics which minimize their risk of being successfully targeted by hostile ground units. The so-called "pop-up" attack run does precisely this, while also ensuring maximum probability of successful payload delivery.
first_strike_capability코0=First Strike Capability
first_strike_capability_desc코0=The best possible combat scenario for our air forces is never having to face air combat at all. Accordingly, it would be prudent to develop the capability to neutralize enemy airbases before an effective response can be mounted, leaving our dominance of the skies unchallenged.
variable_attack_patterns코0=Variable Attack Patterns
variable_attack_patterns_desc코0=Whatever tactics we use, it is absolutely imperative that we keep our forces from becoming predictable. Accordingly, doctrine needs to be devised with multiple options in mind for any given mission profile, offering us flexibility and keeping the enemy on their toes.
countermeasure_systems코0=Countermeasure Systems
countermeasure_systems_desc코0=For every advancement in precision-guided munitions, corresponding vulnerabilities in missile guidance systems appear. These developments must become an integral part of our doctrine and training in order to assure maximum pilot and airframe survivability in a combat scenario.
stealth_integration코0=Stealth Integration
stealth_integration_desc코0=Perhaps no second offset technology has the sheer potential to transform air warfare as stealth. Integrating low-observable and stealth aircraft into our aviation doctrine will be utterly transformative for our ability to comprehensively control the battlespace.
joint_air_operations코0=Joint Air Operations
joint_air_operations_desc코0=He who flies alone, dies alone. If we commit air resources to a mission, we must ensure that they are comprehensively supported by all available air, land, sea, and space assets, regardless of service or command. Enhancing this coordination will greatly improve our global fighting capabilities.
mission_specialties코0=Mission Specialties
mission_specialties_desc코0=In the changing technological landscape of the post-Second Offset world, our military planners must be able to think on their feet and recognize emerging mission paradigms, allowing us to better structure and deploy our forces to meet any threat.

### Air Superiority
air_superiority코0=Air Sovereignty
air_superiority_desc코0=Our air force must be dedicated to defending our nation and asserting sovereignty over our own skies. By building a force of fighters and interceptors, the air force is mainly dedicated to defending our nation from enemy aerial units.
defensive_tactics코0=Defensive Tactics
defensive_tactics_desc코0=Radar and interception is integral to maintaining aerial dominance, and developing defensive tactics to quickly intercept incoming fighter jets and bombers is important for defending the nation's home skies. 
offensive_area_denial코0=Offensive Area Denial
offensive_area_denial_desc코0=Area denial tactics emphasize denying the enemy entry into specific strategic regions through traps and preparations against incoming enemy units. Fighters and interceptors can deny incoming foes by executing a ruthless offense.
rolling_thunder코0=Rolling Thunder
rolling_thunder_desc코0=Wars are won by the industrial capabilities of the nations involved. Massive bombardment campaigns over infrastructure, factories, military bases, and the front lines should substantially weaken the opponent's morale and wartime capabilities.
fire_support_coordination코0=Fire Support Coordination
fire_support_coordination_desc코0=Fire support coordination measures ensures closer cooperation between air and ground forces. The goal of coordination is to focus greater air force measures on higher-priority land targets, as well as closer coordination with anti-air support units.
point_air_defense코0=Point Air Defense
point_air_defense_desc코0=Defending crucial military bases and industry is essential when facing a bombing campaign. Interceptors must be stationed near strategically important locations to ensure our nation defends what is necessary for war. 
maximized_sortie_rate코0=Maximized Sortie Rate
maximized_sortie_rate_desc코0=Bombers are meant for the battlefield, where they must be efficiently deployed to overrun the enemy troops. We can maximize this deployment by implementing modern engineering methods to ensure bombers carry out their mission efficiently without being targeted by interceptors.
infrastructure_disruption코0=Infrastructure Disruption
infrastructure_disruption_desc코0=Enemy troops are commonly deployed away from the front lines, meaning transportation is important to their rate of deployment. By bombing enemy roads, railways and networking systems, our bombers will hurt enemy morale and stability.
nap_of_the_earth_maneuvers코0=Nap-of-the-Earth Maneuvers
nap_of_the_earth_maneuvers_desc코0=When our air assets are operating in potentially hostile areas, we need to ensure that they aren't detected and blown to kingdom come. Nap-of-the-Earth Maneuvers, or NOE, will involve aircraft flying very low to the ground. This will help avoid enemy detection, and keep our pilots safe.
quick_reaction_groups코0=Quick Reaction Groups
quick_reaction_groups_desc코0=The unpredictability of modern war means that we must be constantly ready. By assigning aircraft to quick reaction groups, our air power will always be on call to assist ground forces in whatever situation they've found themselves in.
saturation_bombing코0=Saturation Bombing
saturation_bombing_desc코0=We must deny our enemies use of their terrain and resources as much as possible. New modifications to our bomber aircraft will allow our air force to deliver more payloads, with more destructive power, more consistently than ever. It's massively destructive, but surely effective.
standardized_bombing_formations코0=Standardized Bombing Formations
standardized_bombing_formations_desc코0=Our new bombers can cause more destruction than ever before, but if they're being shot down and moving in disorganized fashion, they aren't worth nearly as much. We should develop new and improved formations for our bomb squadrons to utilize in the field.
deep_air_support코0=Deep Air Support
deep_air_support_desc코0=We can't just use our air power to attack the enemy in the field of battle. In an environment where infrastructure and industry are vital to military success, attacking enemy targets outside of the immediate combat zone will be vital.
numerical_superiority코0=Numerical Superiority
numerical_superiority_desc코0=As traditional wisdom states, more is better. In any given battle, maneuvering to make sure we have more planes than our enemy is critical. Our planners will be trained to seek numerical superiority, and then to push upon the advantage.
maritime_patrol코0=Maritime Patrol
maritime_patrol_desc코0=We can project our aerial superiority upon the sea, preventing surprise naval attacks. Our aircraft will be used to monitor important stretches of ocean, early spotting can give our Navy the opportunity to engage other ships on our terms.
raiding_interdiction코0=Raiding Interdiction
raiding_interdiction_desc코0=In the face of an oncoming battle, choice air attacks can be launched to change coming events in our favor. Through the use of close air support, we can strike at enemy forces hours or even days before a battle. By the time our troops engage, the enemy will be considerably weakened. 
role_consolidation코0=Role Consolidation
role_consolidation_desc코0=With increasingly sophisticated aircraft, planes are no longer constrained to holding a single role on the battlefield. A modern jet can lay out ground targets, as well as bring down other aircraft. These multi-capable planes will give us untold flexibility.

### Air Parity
air_parity코0=Battlefield Support
air_parity_desc코0=War has changed, and our country is in need of an air force that prioritizes supporting land units. This strategy is useful in ensuring victories in small confrontations and skirmishes, which is particularly useful in guerrilla warfare.
light_strike_groups코0=Light Strike Groups
light_strike_groups_desc코0=Our helicopters may be good to use hit and run tactics due to the speed and low profile of them. If we attach small infantry groups to each helicopter, they can land in and out of hot-zones and be much faster than sending an armored section while giving support.
low_risk_engagements코0=Low-Risk Engagements
low_risk_engagements_desc코0=When facing a larger, more capable air force, our units must chip off lone enemy air units and carefully manage engagement, as we could not handle a full-on confrontation. This strategy is particularly useful for interceptors and air support in grouping them together against weaker enemies.
defined_helicopter_roles코0=Defined Helicopter Roles
defined_helicopter_roles_desc코0=With the current nature of combat, we should start to define teams for our helicopters. Medical evacuation helicopters and units will start to be assigned and to be given orders. Our crews will start to be trained more rigorously to become more efficient in combat.
ground_formation_disrutpion코0=Ground Formation Disruption
ground_formation_disrutpion_desc코0=Quick missions to the front line will allow a degree of air support to our troops while limiting the time we are over enemy lines. This allows our aircraft to avoid much of the enemy anti-aircraft, while being within the cover of our own.
helicopter_support_teams코0=Helicopter Support Teams
helicopter_support_teams_desc코0=Our forces need to be able to become mobilized fast in order to be ready for combat. Our landing zones need teams that will be able to help attach vehicles and other equipment to transport helicopters using the hook system located on the underbelly. 
ground_support_integration코0=Ground Support Integration
ground_support_integration_desc코0=Bombs from above hit their targets more often when guided by the steely eyes of the men below. We can establish this fruitful relationship by assigning forward air controllers to our companies, armed with radios and direct channels to the nearest gunship.
air_interdiction코0=Air Interdiction
air_interdiction_desc코0=Our forces should attack enemy units not deemed an immediate threat and destroy them. These engagements will save us a large amount of grief later on by reducing the enemy's ability to deploy their forces against us.
armed_reconnaissance코0=Armed Reconnaissance
armed_reconnaissance_desc코0=With the number of helicopters doing reconnaissance growing, the lightly armed helicopters have started to run into issues when it comes to fighting back. We can start to arm the helicopters with more guns and even a door gunner in some cases to return fire if needed.
medium_range_missions코0=Medium Range Missions
medium_range_missions_desc코0=Armies rely on reconnaissance elements to extend their influence within the battlefield. Specialized training for our own reconnaissance squadrons increase the distance they can cover and, in turn, the extent of our control over the AO.
prioritized_targets코0=Prioritized Targets
prioritized_targets_desc코0=There are only so many bombs and shells a bomber or gunship can unleash onto an enemy force, often outsized by the numbers they leverage into battle. Thus, our pilots must consider where their munitions can do the most damage at all times.
