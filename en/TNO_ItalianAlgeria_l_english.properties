#Starting Ideas
ILG_Wild_Frontier코0=The Wild Frontier
ILG_Wild_Frontier_desc코0=As an unofficial military governorate in de jure French territory, we do not receive much attention from Rome. This has essentially rendered us useless and impotent, and our only hope for survival is aid from our Italian brethren.

ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement코0=Unofficial Italian Settlement
ILG_Unofficial_Italian_Settlement_desc코0=Due to the fact that the territory is ripe for settlement, many poor Italians have immigrated in the hopes of acquiring land. Needless to say, mass immigration of Italians will only compound our miseries due to our weak hold over the area.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad코0=Rampant Banditry
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Bad_desc코0=A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements. However, it is at a boiling point, as destitute natives flock to their ranks in the hope of emerging out of poverty, thus making Italian control even more difficult to maintain.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Crisis코0=Rampant Banditry
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Crisis_desc코0=A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements. However, it is at a boiling point, as destitute natives flock to their ranks in the hope of emerging out of poverty, thus making Italian control even more difficult to maintain.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Prevalent코0=Rampant Banditry
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Prevalent_desc코0=A limited military presence and a lack of manpower means that bandits constantly raid our convoys and loot settlements. However, it is at a boiling point, as destitute natives flock to their ranks in the hope of emerging out of poverty, thus making Italian control even more difficult to maintain.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Problematic코0=Banditry Curbed
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Problematic_desc코0=While our military presence in most parts of Algeria is still limited, we have been able to reduce the scope of criminal operations.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Weakened코0=Banditry Curbed
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_Weakened_desc코0=While our military presence in most parts of Algeria is still limited, we have been able to reduce the scope of criminal operations.

ILG_Saharan_Bandits코0=Banditry Eliminated
ILG_Saharan_Bandits_desc코0=Banditry has been eradicated from the Saharan provinces of Algeria. While Iberian saboteurs and terrorists still make their raids in the border regions, at least we are able to prevent them from wreaking havoc upon our outposts, convoys, and villages.

ILG_Military_Boost_1코0=Basic Desert Training
ILG_Military_Boost_1_desc코0=With some reforms, and some training, our men will be able to fight and govern the sands of Algeria.

ILG_Provisional_Government코0=Provisional Government of Algeria
ILG_Provisional_Government_desc코0=With this step forward, we state the right of the peoples of Algeria to form a state, even if the land is nominally French. However, with a bureaucracy and functioning system, Algeria will prosper!

#Leader Description
POLITICS_GIUSEPPE_CASTELLANO_DESC코0=General Giuseppe Castellano is perhaps one of the most common topics of gossip among the upper circles of the Regio Esercito. A veteran of two world wars, he served with distinction in the Balkans during the last World War, before rising up the ranks of the Italian high command. Castellano's ambition reached high, but destiny had other plans - a few years after the end of the war, the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, entrusted Castellano with watching over the lawless Algerian frontier.\n\nCastellano has been the head of the Algerian Military Territory for a few years now, but his leadership was not very much effective in amending the situation in the region. Italian settlers, mostly from Sicily and often tied to old mafia families, were enticed by Algeria, as the region was perceived to be far from the watching eye of the authorities in Rome. Settlers' enclaves now dot the Algerian landscape, and many rumors circulate about the true extent of Castellano's relationships with the mafia; and the instability is only further fueled by Rome's decision to support native Algerian militias, such as the Front de Libération Nationale, in their armed struggle against encroaching Iberian authorities and their Pied Noirs allies.\n\nThe Governor General, stranded in Algeria and given very little resources to actually do his job, was largely forced to sit and watched as the situation further slipped away from his grasp. However, with renewed tensions arising in the Triumvirate, soon Algeria and Castellano might find themselves in the spotlight once more. Once that happens, perhaps Castellano will have his chance to redeem himself in the eyes of Italy - from a general ruling over a backwater corner of the Empire through shady deals and backroom negotiations, to a hero of the nation who saved its frontiers from the many enemies who would threaten it.
