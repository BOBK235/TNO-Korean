VIN_THENEWORDER_DESC코0=The Empire of Vietnam is a nation tearing itself apart at the seams. Since The Greater East Asian War ended Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Diem have been jockeying for control in the capital, preventing any real reforms to the nation crippled by war. All while The Viet Minh and growing numbers of Japanese Settlers carve up the countryside. All these matters are made even worse by the nation's near total reliance on Japan in all matters of national security.\n\nWhatever was gained from independence has been snuffed out by this civil strife, and only a slight gust of wind is needed to bring it all down.

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC코0=Bao Dai is a man haunted by could-have-beens; as a child, he was raised to the throne more or less by decree in the wake of his father's death, and his moves have been carefully planned by others for most of his life since then. Not much has improved significantly since the days of his youth; the puppet masters now speak Japanese rather than French, and the grain convoys go to Osaka and Nagoya rather than to Paris, but Vietnam still chafes under a foreign boot, and he with it. And he is powerless to stop it.\n\nAs emperor, Bao Dai has grown increasingly autocratic in his rule, preferring to rule without the help of his council. Which is ironic, considering those he relies upon to do his bidding are themselves loyal more to their paymasters in Tokyo than to the Emperor. Most of the rest of the country is indifferent to his decrees in any case, as Vietnam churns with rebellious sentiment and insurgents, just as it did in the last days of French rule. Ho Chi Minh lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce, and the overlords wait for a misstep to justify further intrusion.\n\nBao Dai sees his present and yearns for lost futures, for the dream of an independent and strong Empire that died when the Japanese marched in. His regrets are Vietnam's own; but unlike him, Vietnam has a chance of forging its own path and making it out alive. Bao Dai knows that when the future comes for him, he will be swept away, just another cobweb in the dusty hall. It's not like he has a choice in the matter.



### Ideas ###
VIN_vietcong_idea코0=Viet-Cong
VIN_vietcong_idea_desc코0=The Viet-Cong have a large degree of influence throughout Indochina. Organised and focused, they have been successfully disrupting our supply lines for years now and only get stronger by the day.
VIN_agrarian_society코0=Agrarian Society
VIN_agrarian_society_desc코0=Despite our nation's close links with the industrial powerhouse that is Japan, we have largely failed to modernise and industrialise.
VIN_japanese_rubber_exports코0=Japanese Rubber Exports
VIN_japanese_rubber_exports_desc코0=Vietnam has become one of the largest rubber exporters in the Japanese sphere and we are often treated unfairly in order for them to capitalise.
VIN_japanese_army코0=Japanese Military Restrictions
VIN_japanese_army_desc코0=Believing Vietnam to be a cauldron of nationalistic thoughts the Japanese administration banned the new Empire from controlling any form of armed forces. However, there have been talks throughout both Japan and Vietnam over lifting these restrictions if requested....
VIN_Crippling_Illiteracy코0=Crippling Illiteracy
VIN_Crippling_Illiteracy_desc코0=The French had little interest in education in Vietnam during it's time as a colony. Thus, the vast majority of the country suffers from mass illiteracy. The average Vietnamese citizen lacks even basic reading and writing skills. This situation cannot be allowed to last if we intend on reform.

### Events ###
vietnam.1.t코0=Vietnam in 1962
vietnam.1.d코0=The conception of a Vietnamese nation has existed since before Christ, with the Nam Viet state under the Japanese Empire. As time went by, the concept of a Vietnamese state modernized with the arrival of French colonizers in the 1800s, who exploited the population over the decades. From the First World War to the Second, the French plundered Vietnam of it's resources in wars of imperialism. With the fall of France, Vietnam and, by extension, Indochina, was severed from the Empire. Left to their own devices, the local monarchs and emperors who had suffered under the French boot rose to rule their new nations.\n\nIt was not long, however, before the conquests of the Japanese Empire came to Indochina. Vietnam, along with the rest of the region, were turned into satellite states under the Rising Sun. Under Emperor Bao Dai's collaborator government, Vietnam would enjoy a period of relative peace during the Pacific War. Even still, the nation was not independent, and this spurred resentment among many that Saigon had simply traded one overlord for another.\n\nIn the years since, Vietnam has become a centerpiece of Japanese rule in Indochina, working hand in hand for the prosperity of the region. However, tensions run high once again, as a growing communist insurgency has begun to gain popularity. Faced with an illiterate, poverty-stricken and exploited nation, the Annamite Emperor faces a long road to modernity.
vietnam.1.a코0=Interesting

vietnam.2.t코0=Phan Huy Quat has been Assassinated!
vietnam.2.d코0=On route to his daily audience with the Emperor, Prime-Minister Phan Huy Quat's car was driven off the road by a group of Viet-Cong bandits. While their identities remain a mystery, witnesses claim upwards of ten would-be assassins. The initial crash left the Prime-Minister largely unharmed, limited CCTV footage reveals one of the masked bandits firing several rounds into the car, ultimately killing the wounded Prime Minister. Emperor Bao Dai commented on the situation, stating that 'Enough is enough' and that 'collaboration or elimination of the Viet-Cong is a necessity in the interests of national safety.\n\n No matter what happens next, the long complacent status quo has forever been shifted...
vietnam.2.a코0=The Emperor shall take temporary power...

vietnam.3.t코0=Foreign Minister Diem denounces the attack
vietnam.3.d코0=Ngo Dinh Diem, long serving Foreign Minister, popular public figure and staunch republican, has denounced the recent assassination of Phan Huy Quat, calling the Viet-Cong a 'cowardly group with an equally as pitiful leader'. However, Diem also took the chance to criticise the Emperor, saying his plea for collaboration was no better than 'pulling the trigger' himself.
vietnam.3.a코0=Go back to schmoozing Diem...

vietnam.4.t코0=The Emperor must choose...
vietnam.4.d코0=With the death of Phan Huy Quat, we have been left without a Prime Minister. Two significant figures have risen to the notice of the Emperor, and both seek the position. Ngyuen Ton Hoan is a loyal monarchist, but also a reformist. Staunchly against both imperialism and communism, Hoan seeks to reform the Vietnamese nation into a modern constitutional monarchy. Alternatively, Ngo Dinh Diem represents a far more radical faction in the Vietnamese government. Accused of being a closet Republican, Diem is openly for a fascist Vietnamese government, arguing that Vietnam can be reformed along similar lines to those of the German Reich or Italian Empire. His expansionist, violent tendencies might lead Vietnam down a far darker path.
vietnam.4.a코0=Nguyen Ton Hoan
vietnam.4.b코0=Ngo Dinh Diem

vietnam.5.t코0=Vietcong Raid!
vietnam.5.d코0=The Vietcong have attacked various government buildings throughout the country in a large, coordinated raid. Several officials have been assassinated, and many civilians have begun to show more open support for the Communist cause given our inability to protect them from attacks. Bombings on industrial facilities and rubber plantations have also caused considerable damage to our production capabilities.
vietnam.5.a코0=Damned Reds!

vietnam.6.t코0=Successful Search and Destroy Mission!
vietnam.6.d코0=Working with the Imperial Japanese Army, our forces have attacked several Vietcong positions throughout the country. In a series of swift raids, we've been able to seize considerable amounts of Vietcong equipment, and have captured several hundred enemy combatants. Our success has temporarily set the Vietcong forces back, for now, but further raids will be required if we intend to fully defeat them.
vietnam.6.a코0=Excellent!

vietnam.7.t코0=Failed Search and Destroy Mission
vietnam.7.d코0=Working with the Imperial Japanese Army, our forces have attacked several Vietcong positions throughout the country. The raids proved a catastrophic failure, as we sustained heavy losses attacking entrenched and prepared Vietcong positions. Ultimately, our meager strike teams were forced to retreat, handing the victory over to the Communist forces. This has been a major failure for us, and a major propaganda victory for the Vietcong.
vietnam.7.a코0=That's unfortunate.

VIN_Vietcong_desc코0=The Vietcong Guerillas, largely made up of communist forces, have been actively fighting the Vietnamese government for several years now. Acting out of the lawless border regions near Laos and Cambodia, the Vietcong have largely continued to exist because of their underground support network. If we're going to combat the threat of Communist insurrection, we're going to need to make some difficult decisions.\n\nIf we allow support for Communism to grow too high, then the Vietcong may attempt to seize control of the government.
