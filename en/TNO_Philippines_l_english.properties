PHI_THENEWORDER_DESC코0=In 1942, Manuel L. Quezon broadcasted the declaration of the abandonment of Manila and resigned. What followed was the re-establishment of the position of Governor-General and the Military was assigned to guide the Philippines during this time of the war. After the war the military returned their powers to the Presidency, which had seen it's power stripped down. Effective control outside the of Manila is still with the Military who, in collaboration with The Kenpeitai and Aristocracy, work only for themselves. Newly appointed President Camilo Osias longs to bring an end to this divide that has seen the nation stagnant over the last two decades, but does not have the political clout to do so. If successful Osias will be able to bring about an end to the de-facto military rule and lead the nation into a bright future.
PHI_The_Balancing_Act코0=The Aquino Presidency.
PHI_The_Balancing_Act_desc코0=My Dear Presidente, we have inherited a mess to clean from the irresponsibilities of the presidents before us. The Occupational Authorities run rampant throughout Luzon and Mindanao, while the Gentry continue to defy our orders in an act of grand disloyalty and borderline treason, that is, if their beliefs about our government were not true. However, with enough ambition and drive, we will be able to birth a Grand Republic from its wake, given careful consideration and planning. \n\nTo start, [?PHI_Landlord_Loyalty_State_Central_Islands|G]% of the Gentry in the Central Islands support our cause, meanwhile, loyalty in Samar, Palawan, and Cebu are [?PHI_Landlord_Loyalty_State_Samar|G]%,[?PHI_Landlord_Loyalty_State_Palawan|G]%, and [?PHI_Landlord_Loyalty_State_Cebu|G]% respectively. \n\nMeanwhile, our most populated centres are currently strongarmed by the Kenpeitai. If we are smart, we can be able to seize these islands under the same pretext they had used to take away our power. Currently, the level of banditry in Luzon is [?PHI_Kenpeitai_State_Luzon|R]%, while in Mindanao it is [?PHI_Kenpeitai_State_Mindanao|R]%. If Banditry reaches above §R60%§!, then we will practically be invited in by the Occupational Authorities. However, there is nothing against using more unapproved methods but the wavering opinion of the Japanese of our Presidency, currently their opinion of us lies at [?PHI_Kenpeitai_Faith|G]%.\n\nGood luck, Mi Presidente, you will certainly need it.


#Leader Bios
POLITICS_BENIGNO_AQUINO_JR_DESC코0=Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr. lived his childhood admiring the humble news reporter. He listened without fail to broadcasts of reports both historic and forgettable, spoken by voices ranging from rich baritones to deep basses. Theirs is a thankless job enlightening the public with current events, the scion thought, and informing them of what must be done. His pursuits in Ateneo de Manila University all revolved around being a journalist by trade, so he can assume the soothing duties of his faceless idols as well.\n\nThen his father was elected President of the Philippines in 1952. Suddenly, the Second Republic's eyes turned expectantly towards its second President's firstborn son. Journalism became a distant dream not long after, displaced by endless politics and the expectations thrust upon who soon will become President no. 3. That became reality come 1958, and Ninoy found himself at the driver's seat of a country in great turmoil. Yet the sense of public duty his love for journalism had engendered never left him; with that in mind, he thrust himself fervently towards the duties of the Philippines' highest office.\n\n(Few dared to dispute the results. Those who did became frequent hosts to friendly military police, and either changed tune or disappeared. With threats both overt and covert, Japan had made its position clear: their most loyal servants deserve to win.)\n\nIt is now the year 1962, and Aquino Jr. has since spent four years stitching his country into proper shape. Negotiations with rebels, hacienderos, zaibatsu, and many more factions continue apace. Constabularies now enforce Manila's law from Pampanga to Tayabas. Livelihoods return with every new factory and farm built. No doubt future generations will name cities and streets in honor of who they see as a great reformer -- but for the would-be journalist, serving his country and his people is a reward in and of itself.

PHI_Banditry코0=Mass Banditry
PHI_Banditry_desc코0=The War of Liberation may have ended, but its warriors fight battles still. In the jungles and mountains of Las Filipinas, thousands of hardened men engage in fierce firefights against both the Japanese and the Second Republic. For twenty years they had made the hinterlands of Luzon and Mindanao their battleground, where Manila's authority has long since collapsed. Some denounce them as "bandits", yet others whisper "freedom fighter" in dark alleys and private meals; whatever the label, few deny the lengths they will go to achieve their nebulous aims.

PHI_dictatorship코0=Dictatorship of the Badge
PHI_dictatorship_desc코0=In theory, the Empire's "peacekeeping forces" only assist the Second Republic in protecting its citizenry and developing its embryonic police and armed forces into efficient, self-sufficient arms of the law. In practice, the onerous task of pacifying the provinces has fallen not onto the country's Constabulary, but onto Japanese garrison commanders and their de facto auxiliaries. They had since established themselves as the ultimate authority in the corners Manila had either forgotten or cannot reach. Presidents must take caution when dealing with the garrisons, however, for they alone prevent tenuous peace from collapsing into bloody anarchy...

PHI_democracy코0=Democracy of the Gentry
PHI_democracy_desc코0=A closer look at the Philippines' government will reveal that "Southeast Asia's first democracy" is no democracy at all. Families great and small, from Aquinos to Estradas to Osmenas and Marcoses, manage their cities and provinces like fiefdoms in the President's name. From their seats of power flow founts of writ and law, exacerbated by the meekness of Manila's own authority. Rather than being a government of the people, the Second Republic is instead a government of the dynasts -- a court of petty princes which the king among them must herd. And both they and the Japanese prefer things this way.
