POLITICS_MOUSSA_TRAORE_DESC코0=Moussa Traoré is not a man of many allegiances, but there are three he holds close to his heart. He is a proud muslim, a friend of the French, and an anti-communist. His militias hold that close to their heart as well, which is exactly why he declared opposition to the Malian Government and that rat Keïta, and now, he holds the light against the socialist menace in the southwest.\n\nBorn in a village named Sébétou, Traoré was born three years before the war in Europe, and four years before the mainland fell. By the time the French were being bombed, he had already joined Keita's militias as a teenager. Taught the proper nature of Islam by his older militiamen, Traoré grew to hate the progressive Keita as he advanced through the military. He also began to take certain sympathies towards the French. Occasionally, he would show up with a bag of French guns that he said had come from a well-done raid, but his local clique of ragtag militiamen knew better that he had been making deals with them.\n\nAs the bombings petered out, Traoré and his militias began to consolidate power northwest of what was controlled by Keita, slowly increasing in influence as more and more people began to defect to this new government in Kayes. Before it was too late, Traoré declared another Mali state separate to the one controlled by Keita. Now, the game begins, and Traoré will smash the socialist scum, with the light of God firmly on his side.
