POLITICS_PUYI_DESC코0=The Kangde Emperor, more popularly known around the world as Aisin Gioro Puyi, is somewhat of a relic of the old days of China. Born into the Aisin-Gioro family, Puyi was brought up the heir to a great throne - the throne of the Qing dynasty. He ascended it in 1908 and proved to be an incompetent ruler, ruthless to his eunuchs and servants. However, there was a side of him unknown to anyone except himself and his wet nurse, Wang.\n\nIn 1912, Puyi was forced to abdicate the throne to make way for the newly-founded Republic of China. He lived a normal life, living in a small palace, until the Japanese snatched him away and gave him an offer to lead a country - the Empire of Manchuria.\n\nNow, as the first Emperor of Manchuria, Puyi is locked away inside his palace, a faithful servant to the Japanese. He is nothing more but a shadow.
