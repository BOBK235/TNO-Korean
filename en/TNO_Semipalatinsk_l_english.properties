### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_SABIT_MUKANOV_DESC코0=Sabit Mukanov is truly a self-made man, arising from poverty and eventually becoming involved in political, social, and public affairs after the February Revolution. Mukanov's true fame originates from his career as a writer and poet, and many of his works would share the theme of reflecting prerevolutionary Kazakh life and culture from a postrevolutionary standpoint. He would be hailed as one of the greatest writers in post-revolutionary Kazakhstan and one of the fathers of modern Kazakh culture. \n\nAs the war ended and the years passed, Mukanov eventually become a liberal nationalist. His fame and writing would attract disenfranchised Red Army soldiers from around Kazakhstan to join his movement, the movement for a liberal democratic Kazakhstan. Although his republic is small, it is considered by some as a potentially flourishing democracy. While Mukanov is ambitious in his goals, he is beginning to grow old and it is not known if he can even live long enough to see the democratic Kazakhstan that he dreams of.

SEM_young_democracy_desc코0=Our efforts to establish a truly free and democratic Kazakhstan are beginning to bear fruit; the people are growing more receptive to democratic rule and we slowly witness our system blossoming. However with these signs of progress come the growing pains, and our young democracy is still relatively vulnerable. Nonetheless, we will continue. Kazakhstan and its people must be free!
SEM_stable_democracy코0=A Stable Democracy
SEM_stable_democracy_desc코0=Our labors have finally paid off, for our domain has developed into a fully stable democracy, supported by its people and the newly-developed civil society. No despotic warlord will trample over our people's freedoms and be accepted for doing so, not in our province at the very least. Our internal work is done, and the only thing that remains is bringing our system's benefits to the entirety of Kazakhstan. Then, and only then, can we truly rest.
