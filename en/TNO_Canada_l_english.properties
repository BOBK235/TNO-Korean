### Leader bios ###
POLITICS_LESTER_B_PEARSON_DESC코0=Born in Ontario in 1897, Lester B. Pearson is widely seen as one of the greatest diplomats of his generation. After scoring top marks in the Canadian foreign service entry exam in 1927, Pearson began a distinguished career. His posting in 1935 to the High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom, and then to Washington D.C. in 1942, saw him reach the apex of his diplomatic career at a relatively young age. Yet his time as a diplomat was spent in the shadow of the catastrophic Second World War.\n\nThe fall of the United Kingdom left Canada adrift and increasingly reliant on its American ally. Entering Parliament as a Liberal MP in the dark days of 1946, Pearson's tireless work as an assistant to Mackenzie King's foreign ministry marked him as promising liberal politician. The former diplomat did not spend the following decade of Conservative government idle, advocating strong ties to America and strengthening the OFN as a shield for the free world. His work organizing nonpartisan efforts to better Canada's reputation in non-aligned countries as made him one of the most famous politicians of the former British Empire throughout the fifties.\n\nThe Conservatives' defeat in 1958 saw the liberals sweeping back in power with a platform of social programs and increased OFN cooperation, with Lester B. Pearson at the helm. The world waits to see if the former diplomat can continue to pilot Canada's domestic and foreign policy to a brighter future.
POLITICS_JOHN_DIEFENBAKER_DESC코0=Born in Ontario in 1895, John Diefenbaker is one of the more senior men in Canadian politics. Serving with distinction in the First World War, he developed a disdain for the way in which politicians seemed so eager to throw away the lives of Canadian boys. Upon returning to Canada after the war, he went to law school, and from there, his political career truly began. Joining politics officially in 1924, he was drawn to the Conservative Party, mainly for its opposition to free trade, which he believed would make Canada dependent on the United States.\n\nFour decades later, however, to say that John Diefenbaker is a tired man would be a gross understatement. Run after run, election after election, the Tories have found themselves at the short end of the stick. The Progressive Conservatives are a dying party, failing to win an election and establish a majority since the 1930's. The popular reign of the Liberal Party for the past 30 years has worn down on Diefenbaker, and this weariness is visible in his disposition and policy. A landslide loss to Pearson and his Liberals in '58 has done little to endear Diefenbaker to the current government.\n\nIn addition, the main reason that Diefenbaker ever threw in his lot with the Tories in the first place, fear of Canadian dependence on the US, is now more realized than ever before. The OFN has effectively shackled Canada to her southern "ally", dictating both her foreign and domestic policies. Luckily for him, however, the rise of the British Exiles in Canadian politics has presented the Tories with a unique opportunity to steal back the House from Pearson. With political polarization becoming an ever present issue, one thing is certain: if Diefenbaker and the Tories win the House of Commons, Canada will be flipped on its head.
POLITICS_TOMMY_DOUGLAS_DESC코0=Born in Scotland in 1904, Thomas Clement Douglas moved to Canada with his family at the age of 6, settling in Winnipeg. Enrolling at the Baptist Brandon College in the 1920's, Douglas was set to study Theology. While studying there, he became enthralled with the Social Gospel Movement, which claimed that Christianity was just as concerned with social justice as it was with salvation. These social concepts had a deep-rooted effect on the young Douglas, encouraging a career in politics, rather than religion.\n\nAfter completing a Master's Degree and an "interesting" thesis paper, a newly-married Douglas moved to Saskatchewan, becoming a social activist with the CCF. He was eventually elected to the House of Commons in 1935.\n\nIn the 30 years since that election, Tommy Douglas has climbed the political ladder of the CCF. From MP, to Premier of Saskatchewan, to Leader of the CCF, Douglas has risen through the ranks to become one of the most powerful men in the nation. A strong proponent of Universal Healthcare and various other social programs, he has seriously given the Tory and Liberal establishment a run for its money in recent years, as these concepts continually rise in popularity.\n\nDespite a past that could be seen as quite disagreeable by modern standards, and being born outside of Canada, Douglas has become a beloved figure in Canadian politics, his natural charisma bringing thousands to the once-small CCF. If Douglas can manage to keep some of his more eccentric past actions under wraps- particularly his Master's thesis- both his future, and the future of Canada, may become brighter.
POLITICS_PIERRE_TRUDEAU_DESC코0=Pierre Elliot Trudeau carries within him many of the contradictions dividing both Québec and Canada. An opponent of conscription during the second world war, Trudeau later found himself regretting his failure to help fight for freedom in Europe. Despite his Marxist sympathies, the future prime minister made a name for himself in a polemic text defending radical Catholic priests in their conservative defence of poor miners and farmers in Québec. Blacklisted by the provincial government, Trudeau moved to Ottawa to begin a political career. Once more his political views shifted, spurning both hardline catholic conservatism and left wing nationalistic currents of his home province in favor of liberalism, multiculturalism and Canadian unity.\n\nHis rejection of the far left and far right as well as his opposition to Québec nationalism have earned the prime minister many enemies. In the other Canadian provinces, the future prime minister has made a name for himself during his stint as minister in Pearson's cabinet. His refusal to give America unconditional support in its foreign policy as well as his tireless support for bilingualism and liberalism have made him an icon of generational change within the Liberal party. His charms, good looks and counter-cultural appeal have helped him win his way to the Prime Minister's office on a wave of "trudeaumania".\n\nNow the nation awaits as its young Prime Minister prepares to tackle a deluge of reforms and issues in both domestic and foreign policy. The only thing that both fans and critics of Pierre Elliot Trudeau agree on is that the Prime Minister's stubbornness and independent streak is bound to produce a memorable stint in the office, no matter its results.

tno_bad_native_reserves_desc코0=Native Reservations in Canada, are, to put it mildly, terrible. Almost no roads are paved, access to healthcare is deficient to non-existent, education is in shambles, electricity is sporadic, and life is miserable. This situation, as can be expected, is untenable. The CCF is frothing at the mouth over this issue, demanding further funding for the reservations, with other left wing groups backing them. Most liberals believe that the First Nations People must be "integrated" into Canadian culture, through the education of their children. The Tories, however, believe that while integration is important, the budget is already strained to its maximum. The further evolution of this issue has become a major point of contention in Canadian politics, and it will only become worse if not dealt with.
tno_unaddressed_quebecois_terrorism_desc코0=In the past decade, a persistent but minor issue, Quebecois terrorism, has exploded in magnitude. Groups such as the Marxist FLQ (Front de libération du Québec) and the Fascist FUNQ (Front de l'Unité Nationale du Québec) are increasingly becoming a thorn in the side of not only the province, but the entire nation. Despite the sporadic bombings, kidnappings, and occasional assassinations, the CCF do not believe the issue is a major one at this point. They instead claim that the provincial government could handle it if allowed greater freedom and given more federal assistance. Anglo-Quebecois relations are already a point of contention in the party, but most believe that reconciliation with the Quebecois can be made through the promotion of French values, language, and culture throughout the entire nation. The Liberals and Tories hold another view: if the issue gets any worse, the federal government must get involved. All parties agree, however, that the situation in Quebec is a dire one, in need of immediate attention.
tno_CAN_quebecois_conscription_desc코0=An unhelpful problem exacerbating radicalism in Quebec is the conscription of the Quebecois themselves. One of the main reasons for the increase in provincial terrorism is the simple fact that Canada needs more men, constantly. If any sort of war were to break out between the OFN and its enemies, the nation will need as many men as can be mustered, and so, the Quebecois are conscripted. Just like in 1917, this is causing many issues, and is even further worsened by the fact that no major war is currently occurring. If Canada is to quench Quebecois radicalism, this issue must be dealt with.

CAN_pearson_desc코0=Lester B. Pearson is one of the most successful politicians in Canadian history, serving faithfully as the nation's Prime Minister for the past few years. However, Pearson's incredible term is coming to an end. By the end of 1963, it is entirely possible that he and the Liberal Party will no longer be in control of the country. As such, if Pearson is to continue his glorious vision for Canada's future, it is imperative that he is re-elected for another term. The best, and only, way that Pearson sees himself winning, is by dealing with Canada's most pressing issues before his term is finished.
CAN_secure_votes_desc코0=If Pearson is to win the upcoming general election, he and the Liberals must first secure the votes necessary. For the most part, this will be bog standard activities for Canadian politics; campaign trails, rallies, speeches, and big promises. In addition, the Liberal Party itself must be rallied to vote for Pearson, and only Pearson.
CAN_praise_ofn_desc코0=Canadian politics, as a general rule, is extremely divided about the OFN. Both the Tories and the CCF believe Canada is too dependent on the United States economically, politically, and militarily. The OFN, in its current state, is simply a monument to the fact that they're right. Pearson, however, knows that the OFN and cooperation with America is the only way Canada will ever have the ability to be independent. We must create pro-OFN slogans and propaganda, if only to reassure the Americans that Canada will continue to stand against the darkness with them. In addition, due to Pearson's openly pro-OFN stance, we must show the people how much stronger the organization makes Canada, in order to gain greater public support.
CAN_albertan_oil_desc코0=The Liberal Party, as a whole, is divided between those who believe the OFN should be part of the economic backbone of Canada, and those who believe that Canada should focus less on exportation of goods to the US. If Pearson is to rally the entirety of the Liberals behind him, a necessity for his reelection, he must win over this second faction. By enforcing hard limits on the exportation of Albertan Oil to the United States and other OFN member states, anti-OFN Liberals and fence-sitters can be won over to Pearson's side.
CAN_what_is_canada_desc코0=Since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1867, Canada has faced a question: what is Canada? The Canadian national identity is split between the Quebecois and Anglo-Canadians. Many of the latter simply call themselves Canadian, while the Quebecois identify not with the nation, but with their home province. This is the common theme of Canada's woes. The nation does not agree on its own identity. If we are to solve our largest social issues, we must first tackle this problem.
CAN_quebecois_terrorism_desc코0=Quebecois Terrorism is becoming an increasingly important topic in Canadian politics, due in large part to governmental lethargy in dealing with the issue. The Quebecois believe that their people are underrepresented in Canada for how much they are exploited through conscription and taxation. The arrival of the British Exiles in the 40's and 50's has done little to alleviate their woes. Consequently, French-Canadians have taken to radical terrorist organizations such as the Marxist FLQ and Fascist FUNQ to push for greater representation and freedom, by any means necessary. There are several proposed solutions to this problem. The CCF mainly promotes the strengthening of the provincial government and police, while the Liberals and Tories support a more direct intervention by the federal government. What this intervention would involve is a matter of debate, ranging from granting more rights to the Quebecois, to a total crackdown by the army. Obviously an independent Quebec is off the table, but perhaps more rights for French-Canadians, and promotion of the French language, could make Anglo politicians sleep easier?
CAN_flag_question_desc코0=Canada has a problem, a flag problem. Our national standard, representing Canada around the world, has the flag of another country on its canton. The Union Jack waves proudly in the corner of every Canadian flag, and, as can be expected, this has caused a stir among our more patriotic citizens. They believe that Canada, as a sovereign nation of significant import, should have its own unique flag, distinct from that of the mother country. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that there is no longer a mother country, not after Hitler broke her back during Operation Sea Lion. We have a significant amount of former British Nationals living on our soil, including the Royal Family, who would be rather miffed should the Union Jack be removed from Canada's Flag. Virtually all suggested changes include a Maple Leaf, a major Canadian national symbol. This issue has become a rather contentious, with Tories supporting the continued use of the Commonwealth flag, while the Liberals and the CCF both support Leaf flags. While not a major issue at the present time, ignoring it will likely cause further tension between the British Exiles and Native Canadians.
CAN_natives_desc코0=The Native reservations in Canada are in an unacceptable state. Everything from paved roads, to adequate healthcare, to education, are in short supply. Life is hard, grim, and miserable for many of Canada's First Nations groups. The CCF and affiliated parties are absolutely rabid in their pursuit of this issue, demanding further funding for the reservations. They claim that the current living standards found on the reserves are insufferable, and anyone with eyes to see knows that they aren't exactly wrong. The Tories, on the other hand, believe that federal funding is better spent elsewhere, in more pressing issues. The Liberals' convictions are varied and numerous, and, as such, Pearson and his government must decide the future of the First Nations.

CANf.1.t코0=Sir Oswald Mosley Dies at 84
CANf.1.desc코0=Sir Oswald Mosley, Sixth Baronet of Ancoats, died today in his Ottawa home due to complications from advanced Parkinson's Disease. A veteran of the First World War and a Member of Parliament, he was mired in controversy for founding the British Movement of Fascists in the 1930s, and was interned by the British government upon the outbreak of the Second World War. Mosley later fled to Canada upon the war's conclusion, insisting that British fascism was incompatible with German domination and refusing to recognize Edward VIII's collaborator government.\n\nIn Canada, Mosley tried to revive his political career, but had middling success. He attempted to run as MP for Hamilton West in 1949 and 1953 as a member of the Conservative Party, and was defeated on both counts. His last major role in the political sphere was when he joined several other English émigrés in condemning the Official Languages Act and French bilingualism as a whole. Afterwards, he announced his retirement from politics and published a memoir.\n\nMosley is survived by his second wife Diana Mitford Mosley, their sons Alexander and Max, his daughter Vivien and sons Nicholas and Michael from his marriage to the late Lady Cynthia Curzon Mosley, and nine grandchildren. Funeral arrangements have not been publicly announced.
