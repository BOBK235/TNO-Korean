POLITICS_FRANZ_HALDER_DESC코0=The Sword of Damocles is held above England's throat, not by the finest thread, but by the aged, gnarled hands of Franz Halder. Generaloberst Halder has grown old in service to the Greater German Reich, his commission has taken him to Poland, Denmark, Norway, France and into the desolate frozen depths of Russia. After years of touring the world courtesy of the Wehrmacht, Halder has settled in England as Protector of the West. At a single word from him, the Island will burn again as the Cornish Garrison strikes.\n\nGeneraloberst Halder's plans led the Wehrmacht successfully through Poland and he personally commanded the strike against Moscow that left the Russian capital in flames. As a general, Halder is regarded as one of Germany's best, a name to stand proud against such names as 'Manstein', 'Model' or 'Rommel'.\n\nCompared to the frozen hell of Russia or the searing savannahs of Africa, Cornwalll is one of the most desirable postings in the Reich. The preference for sons of officers and party officials; The wealthy and connected. This provides Cornwalll with a steady stream of vital reinforcements and the best matériel to arm its soldiers with. Halder and the Garrison's reward for their diligent service is to be free from the madness that threatens to engulf Germany, in one of the Reich's safer postings. Halder knows however, that no matter how well manned or supplied his post is, they are a small island in a storm tossed sea. The Cornish garrison can only survive with the assistance of the Reich, but that is the one thing they can rely on, right?
