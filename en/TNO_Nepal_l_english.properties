POLITICS_MAHENDRA_BIR_BIKRAM_SHAH_DEV_DESC코0=The great Sovereign King of Nepal, Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, had not always enjoyed absolute power over his subjects. Once, Bikram was just another member of the royal family, subject to the numerous boring duties a monarch bound by a constitutional and representative government. The Rana Dynasty, the conservative family which gave the nation its Prime Ministers since 1846, ensured that the country was ruled with an iron fist, and everyone obeyed the family, even the monarchy. Then, when India became a republic and revolts spread across Nepal, forcing the Rana family to concede power to the monarchy, Bikram saw his chance.\n\nFour years after being crowned King, on a cold morning in December, Prime Minister Bishweshwar Koirala and the parliament he lead was dismissed. The cabinet was kicked out the door, and then the constitution was suspended. Now, with the nation at his command, a new system was in place. A perfected, "guided" democracy, that answered directly to him, and no one else. Surely, the Emperor has no equal; is it not his responsibility to direct the nation correctly?\n\nHe has been able to keep his country together; a combination of successful land reforms and a neutral policy has kept his kingdom from falling apart. But one has to wonder how long will this guided democracy last. Both Japan and India are looking to take the territory for themselves, and the Nepali Congress is promoting non-violent resistance against Bikram and his system. It will be interesting seeing how long this perfect system lasts, and whether it ends loudly or quietly.

nepal.16.t코0=Building a Better Nepal
nepal.16.desc코0= 
nepal.16.a코0=Backwards no more.

nepal.17.t코0=It Could Be Worse
nepal.17.desc코0= 
nepal.17.a코0=We aren't so different, you and me.

nepal.18.t코0=A Better Tomorrow
nepal.18.desc코0= 
nepal.18.a코0=Every dawn is brighter!

nepal.19.t코0=Enemies on All Sides
nepal.19.desc코0=While both Free India and the Republic have their roots in socialism, they are hardly as open to it as we are, instead preferring social fascism, or, worse, pure fascism. To counter this, we must always be alert to the threats just south, to Calcutta, and just west across the Ganges.\n\nAs much as we go through hardships and must focus on internal functionings of the state, we must always remember to keep looking outwards, lest they decide that they have grown tired of communism in Nepal.
nepal.19.a코0=We must be always alert.

nepal.20.t코0=A Class Struggle
nepal.20.desc코0= 
nepal.20.a코0=We must continue the fight against the bourgeoise!

nepal.21.t코0=A Red Everest
nepal.21.desc코0= 
nepal.21.a코0=The revolution on the top of the world.

nepal.22.t코0=Show Trials
nepal.22.desc코0= 
nepal.22.a코0=We have quelled the threat.

nepal.23.t코0=The Execution of the Royal Family
nepal.23.desc코0=Today marked a historic day for the people's Nepal; the execution of the Royal Family.\n\nAt 0600 hours this morning, former King Mahendra was escorted outside of his cell, followed 5 minutes later by his spouse and issue. Mahendra and his family then were lined up on the wall and, at about 0630 hours, were unceremoniously executed by firing squad.\n\nNone of the executed had any last words.
nepal.23.a코0=Just as Robespierre did.

nepal.24.t코0=The Execution of B. P. Koirala
nepal.24.desc코0=Today marked a historic day for the people's Nepal; the execution of B. P. Koirala, leader of the social fascists. Or, at least, it would have if he wasn't in exile.\n\nUnlike the rest of our opponents, Koirala was exiled from Nepal in 1962 to America for what was termed by the reactionary government as rebellious conduct - inadvertedly saving him from the same fate that befell the latter.\n\nWhile we attempt (mostly fruitlessly) to coax America into giving us Koirala, it is the unfortunate truth that we will have to forgo an execution for the time being. However, we have assured the executioners that they will get fresh meat in the near future.
nepal.24.a코0=In absentia - for now.

nepal.25.t코0=The Execution of Man Mohan Adhikari
nepal.25.desc코0=Today marked a historic day for the people's Nepal; the execution of Man Mohan Adhikari, traitor to our true cause of socialism.\n\nAt 0400 hours this morning, Comrade Adhikari was escorted from his prison cell. Afterwards, he was lined up on the wall and, at 0415 hours, was unceremoniously executed by firing squad.\n\nHis last words were, "Nepalako Vijaya! Kamyunijmako Vijaya!"
nepal.25.a코0=There's no room for traitors in Nepal!

nepal.26.t코0=Socialism Flourishes
nepal.26.desc코0= 
nepal.26.a코0=Without weeds, the flower blooms.

nepal.27.t코0=Staying on the Path
nepal.27.desc코0= 
nepal.27.a코0=Perhaps tunnel vision has its benefits.

nepal.28.t코0=Our Revolution
nepal.28.desc코0=Nepal's socialism is uniquely its own. We are not bred by Lenin nor Makhno, nor by the Indians. Nepal's socialism is only that of Marx and Rayamajhi, despite the terminology of our ideology. Some call our beliefs autocratic, while others dare to call us libertarian. However, we know what we want: a free, socialist Nepal. Free from oppression of classes, sexes, and peoples. Free of foreign influence and control. After much hard work and struggle, we have, at long last, achieved our goal!
nepal.28.a코0=Nepalako Vijaya! Kamyunijmako Vijaya!

nepal.29.t코0=The 1969 Riots

nepal.34.desc코0= 
nepal.34.a코0=Declare a state of emergency!
nepal.34.b코0=Let's get outta here!

nepal.35.t코0=The CPN Takes Control
nepal.35.desc코0= 
nepal.35.a코0=Nepalako Vijaya! Kamyunijmako Vijaya!

nepal.36.t코0=The 1971 Riots
nepal.36.desc코0= 
nepal.36.a코0=Cracking down worked once, let's try it again!
nepal.36.b코0=What are they going to do if we ignore them?

nepal.37.t코0=The Riots Die Down
nepal.37.desc코0= 
nepal.37.a코0=Great!

nepal.38.t코0=The Riots Worsen
nepal.38.desc코0=
