### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_IBRAHIM_YUSUPOV_DESC코0=Ibrahim Yusupov's father was a religious cleric and a wealthy landowner, which made him a prime target to be arrested and "disappeared" by Soviet authorities in the 1930s. This left Yusupov to be raised by a single mother, and he was forced to work as a child to keep his siblings fed and clothed. This harsh upbringing, however, did not deter him from his love of poetry, and he was able to complete a literature degree when he was twenty.\n\nYusupov's homeland of Karakalpakstan had been occupied by the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, for the better part of a century, and their autonomy was gradually eroded over the decades. Unsurprisingly, the Karakalpaks were quick to declare independence and fend off any post-Soviet warlords after the Union fell. They were also fortunate enough to gracefully transition from communist rule to a functioning liberal democracy, free of strongmen and tyrants. While other, more authoritarian regimes may have repressed him, the free nature of Karakalpak society allowed Yusupov's career as a poet and journalist to not only be viable, but also flourish. He worked as a newspaper editor and professor of literature, and eventually threw his hat in the ring and ran for President of Karakalpakstan in 1961. His popularity as an author had gone a long way toward building a voter base, and his rhetorical command ensured that he always came out ahead in debates. But now that he has won the presidency, some question whether he can amount to more than simple poems and whether he can actually implement the policies he so lyrically endorsed.
