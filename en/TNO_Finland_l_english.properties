FIN.115.t코0=Finland Offers Conditional Surrender
FIN.115.desc코0=We have made serious gains in our war against the Finns, driving them and their Russian puppets out of our Russia proper. With our invasion of Finland itself well underway, perhaps it is now time for us to send the Finns an offer of conditional surrender? Our terms will be simple: They hand over Murmansk, which is filled with Russian speakers and is our rightful territory, we keep all of Onega, an illegitimate warlord state which never should have existed in the first place, and we both agree to create the Karelian Autonomy, a joint protectorate of both Finland and West Russia that will serve as a buffer state between us and them.
FIN.115.a코0=Accept
FIN.115.b코0=Refuse

FIN.116.t코0=Our Surrender Accepted
FIN.116.desc코0=Helsinki is abuzz as recent news confirms the acceptance of our offer for a conditional surrender by the West Russians. Finland will hand over Murmansk and withdraw from the puppet territory of Onega, and much of Karelia will be governed under a joint Finnish-Russian protectorate, deemed the Karelian autonomy. These are great sacrifices of Finnish territory and influence in the north, but perhaps they will successfully avoid further violence in the region.
FIN.116.a코0=Maybe Finland didn't need those territories anyway.

FIN.117.t코0=Our Surrender Rejected
FIN.117.desc코0=This is a sad day in Finland's halls of power, as diplomatic reports come in that the West Russians have declined our offer for a conditional surrender of power. Evidently, the prospect of anything less than a total Finnish cession of Karelia was not to their liking, as they have decided to push for further territorial gains. As the possibility of massive losses for Finland becomes more likely, many in Helsinki fear for the government's stability, as well as for those Finns who may lose their lives in further fighting.
FIN.117.a코0=The West Russians mean business.

FIN.118.t코0=Finland Offers Unconditional Surrender
FIN.118.desc코0=Diplomats representing the Finnish government have approached us offering surrender once again. This time they have fully  conceded to our demands and are offering to hand over Murmansk, Onega, and all of Karelia east of Viipuri. This would restore the border to its position in 1936 and bring millions of Russians back into the fold. With our rightful territory returned to us and all questions of military supremacy definitely settled by our rout of the Finnish armed forces we have nothing else to gain from the war. It has been a triumphant return of the Russian nation to the world stage, with the reclamation of a valuable region and a decisive victory over a foreign rival to make it all the better. Let us make peace with the Finns and turn our attention to the east. Karelia was just the beginning. Soon all of Russia will be reunited under our flag.
FIN.118.a코0=Wonderful!

FIN.119.t코0=Russia Accepts Our Surrender
FIN.119.desc코0=Our diplomats have returned and informed us that the Russians have accepted our unconditional surrender. All of Karelia east of Viipuri will be returned to them and the border will return to its 1936 position. This is a devastating loss for our nation. Decades of work to restore the Finnish population of our eastern territories and enormous investments in those same regions have been undone. It was only because this sacrifice was necessary to preserve any form of an independent Finland that it was made. Our future that once seemed so bright is now slipping away from us as we fall back under the Russian shadow.
FIN.119.a코0=We flew too close to the sun.

FIN.120.t코0=Finland Offers Ceasefire
FIN.120.desc코0=Though our soldiers have not managed to shatter the Finnish lines as we hoped, we are still making steady advances into their territory. Perhaps fearing that they will not be able to hold us off for much longer, or simply not wanting to expend the blood and treasure to repel us, the Finns have offered us a truce. They propose to cede Onega to us in exchange for an end to the fighting. Shall we accept the treaty as they have offered it to us, or reject it and fight for greater gains?
FIN.120.a코0=Accept.
FIN.120.b코0=Refuse.

### 150
FIN.150.t코0=A Monster On The Sonar Screen
FIN.150.desc코0=At first, it was believed to be a mistake. When the Radar operator on the FNS Karjala reported a blob on his screen, larger than he'd ever seen, it was initially laughed off as a ridiculous glitch by the bridge. The laughing died fairly quickly when the FNS Turunmaa reported the same blob, and then numerous other patrol boats. A quick call and a hasty reconnaissance flight confirmed the worst fears of the government- the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe were out in full force.\n\nBattleships, Bombers, Fighters and Frigates- it was all there. Hell, the recon flight even reported seeing a few converted Swedish ships in the forefront of the pack.\n\nObviously, the message behind this show of force is clear. We will bend the knee to Goring and his gang of lunatics, or we will be wiped off the face of the Earth. While this decision is not to be made yet- they haven't asked about it specifically- some of our more aggressive admirals already recommend an immediate course of action. Their plan is to send out our own ships in a counter exercise, in order to show the strong will of the Finnish people and our government's refusal to back down. This, however, could lead to further conflict.\n\nThe other plan, recommended by much of the civilian government, is to do nothing and let them bluster. To pick a fight with the strongest navy in Northern Europe is to send thousands of men to die, and will only lead to trouble for us. However, simply letting the Germans walk over us is a terrible look, and will only invite further aggression. We are in between a rock and a hard place, and every minute we wait leads to us being squished further. A choice must be made.
FIN.150.a코0=Send out the Navy.
FIN.150.b코0=We cannot fight them.


### 151
FIN.151.t코0=All Hands On Deck
FIN.151.desc코0=The Finnish government was thrown into chaos today as new reports sent shockwaves across the military. The FNS Karelia reported a strange, threatening new move from the German menace. A small detachment of German ships has been spotted, moving away from the main fleet. It is alone, weak, and also intruding on Finnish national waters. Of course, this move severely threatens Finnish national security. If we do not stop the Germans here and now, and protect our sovereign waters, what will stop the GErmans from simply ignoring our naval claims? Because of this, the military has put forth a plan to fire upon the violating ships, and drive them from our waters as a reminder of Finnish sovereignty. Perhaps losing a few thousand men to the frigid waters of the Baltic will put a message through Goring's thick skull.\n\nHowever, this plan has been met with fear and fury from the political elite, who claim that the Finnish navy is no match for the Kriegsmarine. Indeed, spme go as far as to call this a German trick, intent on fooling us into destroying our own navy, Both sides argue this issue as if it is life and death, which it very well may be. We must choose a course of action against this unprecedented threat.
FIN.151.a코0=It's a trick. Send nothing out.
FIN.151.b코0=It's a test. Show our resolve.


### 152
FIN.152.t코0=Slaughter in the Baltic
FIN.152.desc코0=The admiral watched with growing joy as his fleet gained on the Germans. Their ships, puny in number compared to the Finns sent to destroy them, fled before the Finnish Navy. The admiral slowly looked at the armada amassed around him. Every ship in the Finnish Navy had been sallied forth to destroy the foolish Germans, whose arrogance had led them to believe that Finland would simply roll over and allow their sovereignty to be trampled. How stupid of them!\n\nEven as the Germans tried to flee, they must have known that their days were numbered. The Finns outnumbered them, outgunned them, and were now in firing range. The last point was proven when the first salvo was fired, splashing all around the enemy. The admiral couldn't help but crack a grin as the first shots connected, and the slaughter began.\n\nThat is, until he heard the sirens wail above him.\n\nThe admiral, in his startled, looked up to see the full might of the Luftwaffe above him. The sun flashed off the wings of the dive bombers as they unloaded their payloads on to numerous ships. The admiral, along with his crew, watched in stark horror as the first boats buckled and cracked under the weight of the assault, explosions tearing their hulls apart.\n\nAs the admiral watched his pride and joy burn away in front of him, he noticed a plane coming for the ship he stood on. He would only have a moment to comprehend what it was doing before the blast of the bomb engulfed him.
FIN.152.a코0=How could we have fallen for it?


### 153
FIN.153.t코0=An Unusually Large Blip
FIN.153.desc코0=When the sonar operator of the FNS Karjala reported a major blip on his screen, he was first treated with incredulous. When the sonar operator of the FNS Turunmaa reported a similar blip, the air of confusion was replaced with that of dread. A quick reconnaissance flight confirmed the fleet's suspicions- Germany had sent out its fleet, and planes to back it up.\n\nHundreds of planes soar over the bulk of the Kriegsmarine, as they cut through the icy waters of the Baltic. Of course, the flimsy excuse of "simple exercises" provided by the German Embassy have been all but ignored by the government, who sees it as it really is- Germany is back, and it will destroy Finland if we do not comply. For a while, however, it seemed that nothing would truly come of it. The Kriegsmarine did its exercises halfheartedly while part of the Navy stood as a guard for the coast. It seemed that the situation would defuse on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, it wouldn't. Our ships have repeatedly reported small flights of Luftwaffe bombers buzzing their decks, flying directly over them and occasionally diving as if to attack only to pull away at the last minute. This situation has sent our admirals into a frenzy, as they demand to send more ships to the coast to counter these acts of aggression. Increasing the tension in this situation seems to be a terrible idea, but leaving our ships undefended is just as bad. We must make a choice, unfortunately.
FIN.153.a코0=Do nothing. They will leave eventually.
FIN.153.b코0=We need to protect our boys. Send the rest.


### 154
FIN.154.t코0=Aland Seized!
FIN.154.desc코0=Our government was once again thrown into chaos yesterday as a shocking development came from the Aland islands. In a series of increasingly desperate messages, the garrison stationed on the islands relayed information thought to be impossible- Wehrmacht forces have landed and seized the islands, presumably as a jumping off point for a future invasion of our homeland. While Goering has made his fair share of threats against us, our nation, and our future, never has he seized our territory so brazenly, or threatened us so openly.\n\nOur parliament is now split into pieces, as shock and terror runs rampant among our populace. While most of our leaders, including almost all of the generals and admirals, demand that a state of war be declared, our army is not yet entirely ready to hold the German menace back in the case of war. The more pragmatic men among our legislation argue that we continue our policy of retaining and conserving our resources, rather than expending all of our assets over a few rocks in the Baltic. Though this would undoubtedly be an unpopular choice with the hawks, perhaps preparing a defensive struggle will be a more successful strategy. Either way, we must now make our choice.
FIN.154.a코0=We must defend our territory!
FIN.154.b코0=We must prepare further.


### 155
FIN.155.t코0=The Battle of Aland
FIN.155.desc코0=Shocking news has returned from the Aland Islands, as has been a constant in the last few weeks. However, this news is different, in that it is positive. According to frenzied reports from the local garrison, Goring and his band of gangsters attempted an attack on our islands, and would have succeeded had it not been for the swift action of our navy. With the quick thinking and swift action emblematic of a true Finnish warrior, our navy obliterated the landing force, sending thousands of German thugs to rot at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nRaucous celebration and joyous parades have sprung up in major population centers, and already our legislature has come together to issue a statement proclaiming our unity in the face of such adversity. However, some questions have arisen in terms of what we are to do, now that the Germans have been thoroughly defeated. Many of the more hawkish men in our government push for an immediate declaration of war, claiming that this battle shows our superiority to the massed, conscripted men in the Wehrmacht. Other, more pacifistic men have instead pushed for a continuance of our armed neutrality, as they claim that Goering will focus elsewhere after this defeat. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but the fact remains that our men, in a stand up fight against the numbers and equipment of the Wehrmacht, would be facing long odds. Whichever we choose, we can only hope we only win victories such as this.
FIN.155.a코0=Press the advantage! To war!
FIN.155.b코0=We've shown we have claws.


### 156
FIN.156.t코0=The Ultimatum
FIN.156.desc코0=Though previous news between us and the Reich has sent the government into a fearful panic, nothing compares to the latest passage sent to us. In near disbelief, the government sits paralyzed, and all because of one quick note directly from Germania. In this note, Goering himself writes in great detail of the great historical relationship between Finn and German, as if we have not been skirmishing with the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe for the last few months. The first paragraph is laden with compliments to our racial stock, our history, our tradition of "beating back the Bolshevik Russian", and our people. If one was to cut out the first paragraph and only read that, they may think that this was a love letter.\n\nThe second paragraph is decidedly less friendly.\n\nIn the second paragraph, Goering notes the statistics of the Wehrmacht compared to our forces, the disparity in training and manpower, and the hopelessness of our situation. He concludes the letter with a simple offer- join the Unity-Pakt, or die.\n\nThis is no easy thing to answer, as Finnish society tears itself apart over what this may mean for Finland. We must make a choice- can we fend off the Germans for long enough, but run the risk of destruction? Or shall we submit to the Reich's claws, and live to see another day?
FIN.156.a코0=We have no choice.
FIN.156.b코0=We will not lay down and die!


### 157
FIN.157.t코0=A Second Ultimatum
FIN.157.desc코0=The war continues, and with it comes a heavy cost. Thousands of Finnish men die on the field of battle every week, as the German tide slowly grows stronger and stronger. At home, the cities alternate between the silence of a strict curfew and the chaos of daily bombing raids. The countryside slowly empties, either from the men going to war or the people leaving for the safety of the interior. Above all else, our economy falters, with all trade being cut off from the entire world. It seems if we continue this war, the nation may be doomed. \n\nGoering, unbelievably enough, has given us out in the form of a second ultimatum. This letter is significantly more blunt and harsh than the last. There are no formalities or pleasantries. Indeed, the letter is but a paragraph in length. The new ultimatum would, upon our acceptance of the terms, simply incorporate us into Reichskommissariat Skandinavien. There would be no autonomy, or freedom, or any other special circumstance for us, but our people would live to see another day.\n\nHowever, our generals still push to continue the fight. By the observations of both our economists and our military men, the German giant stands on extremely weak legs, buoyed only by the loot of those nations who have fallen to it. If we hold long enough, the Reich may fall in on itself again, allowing us to escape with our independence, our freedom, and above all else, our pride. This would be risky, but in the situation we are in, it must be considered.\n\nWe now come to what may be the greatest crossroad in Finnish history- do we give in and submit to Goering and his thugs, or take a great risk and keep fighting, for the chance of survival?
FIN.157.a코0=We cannot keep fighting.
FIN.157.b코0=Never surrender!

#Leader Bios
POLITICS_KARL_LENNART_OESCH_DESC코0=Throughout of his life, the ultimate goal of Karl Lennart Oesch was to help his country. Now, as its current leader, that wish can be fulfilled.\n\nIn the interwar years, Oesch kept climbing up the vast hierarchy of the Finnish armed forces, gaining more and more prestige as he did so. As Chief of the General Staff, he closely cooperated with General Mannerheim, but still did not earn his full respect and admiration for his talent. That talent would be shown, however, when the tide of war swept Finland, forcing it to enter the Winter War. Despite Oesch's skill in dealing with the most difficult situations, that war was still lost. This was not the first time the country would fight the Russian communists; twice more, in the Eastern Front of World War Two and the West Russian War, Oesch would lead his men into battle. In fact, his incredible success in defeating the WRRF offensive into Karelia, and ever retaking the Onega region, would boost his popularity and influence.\n\nThe glory of his nation was not meant to last long. Following the West Russian War, instability dominated the Finnish political scene, and Oesch had only option: send in the army. A provisional military regime was established under one of the country's most famous generals. The government's popularity was at an all-time low, and another hit to the country would come with the Crash of the 50s. Oesch had worked hard to approach Germany, but that seemed to massively backfire, as the economic depression of the Reich took Finland down with it. And so, the military leader of the nation now has a terrible situation to face: will, amidst the nation's decline, the voices of the people be heard and democracy preserved?

FIN_Nation_of_Strength_desc코0=Following the West Russian War, and the political chaos that enveloped Finland afterwards, the military famously intervened within the government to restore order to the nation, and defend against any future Russian attacks. With the unrest in Karelia, and the need to manage a Russian sphere of influence of Finland's own, the military government has been a boon for Finland through the troubled times of the aftermath of the War and the 50s Crash. The Finnish military has been empowered, emboldened, and expanded - Russia will never again threaten her rightful territories.\n\nOr so it is hoped.
FIN_Uncertain_Future코0=Uncertain Future
FIN_Uncertain_Future_desc코0=The Finnish military government, while a comparatively light-handed one, is not exactly a popular institution. Protests against the regime are common, despite attempts by the police and Army to keep order, and many among the government have made a realization that the regime is not sustainable. Democracy returning to Finland is an inevitability - it is only a matter of whether the military will step down peacefully, and soon, or be forced to capitulate later.
