POLITICS_GEORGY_BASHARIN_DESC코0=게오르기 프로코피예비치 바샤린은 혼돈과 불확실성의 시대에 독자적인 야쿠트인 정신을 가진 사람입니다. Born into a large and poor family of peasants, he was determined to succeed in education. He studied history and literature in Moscow, before returning to his homeland in the last few years of peace for Russia. He avoided conscription both in the war against the Germans and during the Siberian War, when he joined a movement of liberal nationalists aiming to fight for the freedom of the Yakut nation. Soon enough, the troops of the Supreme Soviet were driven out, and the circle of intellectuals seemed to have achieved their dream.\n\nA democratic government was set up, proclaiming a new Yakut Republic and promising grand reforms and liberty for the people. However, no sooner had the fledgling nation been founded than it was struck by reality. The abundance of natural resources like diamonds, thought to be of help in developing the country, became a curse upon it. Local companies formed monopolies in the mining industries, financing their own projects with the profit. Inside Yakutia, they accumulated power, even forming their own "states within the state" with separate militaries to more easily conduct operations. Crime is rampant in the country, with the oligarchs entangled in mafia organizations that freely function without government interference.\n\nAmidst all this, Georgiy Basharin remains a bastion of honesty and transparency, running the republican government the best he can. While he may be universally respected, there is little he can do to fight the oligarchy that has been built around him. For now, all he can hope for is that the fire of Yakut nationalism burns bright.
