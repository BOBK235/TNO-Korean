POLITICS_LADOKE_AKINTOLA_DESC코0=요루바랜드는 항상 자유롭지 못했습니다. It had to earn its independence from the yoke of the Cameroonian pan-Africanists, and key to its foundation was Ládòkè Akintola. When a circle of generals and officers rose up to end the socialist regime over his homeland, finding the skirmishes between them and Zentralafrika as the perfect opportunity, Akintola became their leader and figurehead. Under his command, the Cameroonians were driven out, and since then Yorubaland has managed to hold off any attacks made by them to reclaim their lost lands. And the nations of West Africa are thankful for that, for they are shielded from the pan-Africanists and can continue living in peace.However, things are not as clear and hopeful in Akintola's domain itself. The people admire him, and are thankful that he is there to safeguard the coast from any foreign invaders. And while he may he a dictator, he is not a brutal or a militaristic one, but rules benevolently over his citizens. This despotism will eventually have to end, though. Of course, the last thing he would want would be for the socialists to take power, even though he himself is implementing policies surprisingly similar to their own. Welfare has been established, and many freedoms have been given. As for actual elections, that is a complicated matter for Akintola. Perhaps a number of selected parties could participate in an electoral process, but how can he be so sure that his successors will be able to hold the country together, without the coast of Yorubaland falling to his enemies. He is not, and that is why installing democracy may not be that easy. For now, though, Akintola is content to continue his rule over the strip of land he can control, even if only to keep his enemies out.
