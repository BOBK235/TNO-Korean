japdlc.1.t코0=쑨뎬잉 장군이 체포되다
japdlc.1.d코0=Sun Dianying was relieved after Jessfield 76 had let him go some days prior. He made a note to himself to stay out of the way of secret police in the future, especially now that he would soon be retiring. Still, he had been released and relieved of the burden of their suspicions, at least in an official capacity. It was not as if further interrogations would yield anything more, they had nothing on him and it would continue that way. As he sat by the window, smoking a cheap cigarette, he wondered if any of his colleagues would also be interrogated. Still, the matter was over for him and thus not worth troubling himself too much with.It therefore came as a great surprise to General Dianying, after opening the door to his apartment in the, to be greeted by the sight of three officers of the 헌병대 and a particularly nervous translator. Without as much as a feigned gesture of respect for military rank, he was grabbed and handcuffed by two of the 헌병대 agents, while the third read off a number of charges they had brought against him.Old General Sun Dianying was hurriedly shoved into the back of a featureless truck, while the chinese translator did his best to relay the news to him. Dianying was sure they had nothing on him, just like with Jessfield 76, he couldn't help but feel like he would be taken in for rather longer this time.It didn't take long for the Chinese authorities to notice Dianying's arrest and disappearance into the bowels of the 헌병대's local department. Most troubling though, was the lack of any explanation for the actions of the Japanese agents, who had simply descended upon the old general's quiet apartment complex, without as much as a phone call to any authority in China. A demand for transparency was in order, and it would be coming straight from the General Staff of the ROC. To see their colleague treated in such a manner was a striking insult and regardless of what overruling authority the 헌병대 might have within the Sphere, they had a dangerous line which could not go ignored.

The general staff would demand an answer to two questions relating to General Dianying's capture. Firstly, why had the 헌병대 decided to overrule the thorough and sound interrogation conducted by Jessfield 76? Secondly, why had they decided to abduct the general without as much as a word to the proper authorities, most importantly the ROC General Staff itself? The telegram concluded with a request that should any wrongdoing be discovered, that the generals be allowed to deal with it.The message was then quickly dispatched after being marked as distinctly urgent. Most of the general staff elected to wait for a response, rather than retire to bed and risk finding that the situation had grown ever more appalling. When a reply from the Prime Minister did not arrive after several hours, the general staff were left with two possibilities as to what was occuring in Tokyo. Either the Japanese were still floundering for an appropriate answer to send back to them, or that the Prime Minister had simply decided to ignore their demands outright.

japdlc.4.t코0=내무장관의 첫 보고서
japdlc.4.d코0=With the Prime Minister attempting to keep the ROC General Staff distracted with promises of a soon to be delivered explanation of General Dianying's arrest, it was now up to the Home Minister to formalise a report that would hopefully rectify the increasingly concerning matter.After some dubious reluctance on the part of the 헌병대 stationed in Nanjing, the Home Minister, was finally able to acquire a copy of their report. The initial sections of the documents explained that Diaying had been arrested following the 헌병대's dissatisfaction with the previous efforts of Jessfield 76. Following paragraphs detailed the pressing urgency of acquiring proper information from the old general, with fears that the wider issues being examined by the 헌병대 might grow out of control. The Home Minister found himself more confused than ever, yet there were still more documents to examine.Dianying, as it turned out, was only a small part of something much larger in scale. While the Japanese secret service had naturally dedicated much of their time to eradicating any traces of potential Chinese resistance from the ROC, they had in recent months began to focus on potential infiltration of the Japanese army. Dianying's arrest was an attempt to find a link between the resistance and any Japanese officers that might have become compromised in some capacity.With this revelation now in the hands of the Home Minister, he opted to immediately deliver his report to the Prime Minister in person. As expected, the Prime Minister was deeply concerned with the developments. There was little solace to be had in knowing that the situation in China might be truly disastrous. The Prime Minister could only hope that the 헌병대 prove more forthcoming with their information in the future. As the Home Minister exited his office, he could only stare at the document presented before him, hoping that the characters on the paper might materialise into a solution.

japdlc.5.d코0=The sun was fading. The shadows got longer and longer, until beams shining through the windows created silhouettes in the ground that were outlandishly high, like beasts in a shadow puppet show. [Root.GetLeader] was tapping his foot on the ground anxiously. He had to get the call. For what must have been the fourth time in that hour, he checked the lines. They were not cut or bugged. The lines were secure, but no amount of reassurance would convince him so. The room was too dark. He did not like to see his own shadow. It loomed over him, followed him. It would never leave. He despised it for that. Pulling the cord on the lamp, he read through the papers again, his hands shaking as he pulled them to the light of the lamp. From Nanjing, the 헌병대. All connected to the end of the war with China. The final moments. He remembered those days, how it all seemed so clear. These papers offered a glimpse at those times, when peace in all the world was certain. And that grim photo, sitting atop the neat stack of papers. The body was unrecognizable, crushed by Chongqing rumble and burned to a cinder. All of the evidence was coming together in the most terrifying way. It made [Root.GetLeader] sick to his stomach. The telephone rang. [Root.GetLeader] hesitated for a moment. His heart was beating faster than it had ever rung before, faster then when the bombs hit the enterprise or when the Germans blew up Pearl Harbor.

japdlc.6.t코0=대음모
japdlc.6.d코0=As 헌병대 reports made their way to Tokyo, it was becoming clear to the Home Minister just how truly bad the Chinese infiltration had become. Older reports had little actual basis in their claims of mass infiltration of the Japanese army. They spoke little of Dai Li either, instead presenting a number of theories as to which chinese rebels were believed to still be alive and capable of directing such a plot against the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yet as more and more information arrived at the Home Minister's office, mere rumours and dubious theories began to transform into genuine facts.The name Dai Li began to appear in more and more reports, and as it did, so did the names of many Japanese Officers. Some were believed to have willingly joined with Dai Li's cause, fully aware of their betrayal. Others were seemingly unaware of their crimes, having been misled by the multitude of agents that the Chinese had spread throughout the Sphere. With each moment, with each paper that was read, with each telegram from the Nanjing 헌병대, a conspiracy was being unveiled.As the Home Minister discovered more and more about the seemingly bottomless conspiracy, the circle of those he dared to share his findings with continued to shrink.He had already begun locking away any document pertaining to Dai Li when he left his office for even a moment. He had dismissed his usual assistants too, preferring to copy each file by himself. Another safe, if tedious measure. For now, he would continue to report to the Prime Minister and only ever in person. If anyone else was to hear of Dai Li, it would be on Kantei's authority.

japdlc.9.d코0="So," the 헌병대 officer said to Masahiro, "what did you see in the forests, Lieutenant Masahiro? The HQ would be incredibly interested in the details of such." They sat in gray concrete room, with a single electric bulb alighting their conversation. Masahiro could not hear what was going on outside. The 헌병대 had requested that he come to their office for questioning. That was the scare of his day, words that chilled his soul. Now that he was in the station, he was in the hands of the military police."Well," Masahiro began, "the villagers have sighted a figure walking through the bamboo forests, wearing a cloak made out of the long leaves." He rustled his hands against one another. "They say that it is a spirit of vengeance. You know, like a Chinese version of Youkai. I did not believe them, either. I don't take many walks out there in the woods - but the reports kept coming in. Soon, my office was full of villagers outright gossiping that a spirit of vengeance is coming for us all."The 헌병대 officer looked at Masahiro, noting everything that he said. "Do you believe it, Masahiro-san? Personally?""No, I don't. As I said, I don't take many walks out there in the woods. However, when I do, there is a certain chill that runs through me." He looked down at his fingers. "Like someone was watching me.""Hmm." The 헌병대 officer coughed. "That will be all. Thank you, Lieutenant Masahiro.""Just one question." The officer looked at him intently.

It seems as though he has finally tracked down the ever-elusive Loyal Patriotic Army - or at least, whatever's left of it. Though this was a shot in the dark, it was the only shot the department had at the moment, and time is ticking away before they can yet again bleed into the countryside."Maybe we can finally get this Dai Li shit moving.""Maybe so, Sato-san, maybe so."Takamura and Sato quickly realised that their overstretched police squadrons probably wouldn't be up to task for a job like this and unfortunately, there's only one more authority in the region they could trust to expand this mission with - the army. The pent-up paranoia from interservice rivalry, partisan and "partisan" attacks understandably have made Takamura incredibly reluctant to cooperate with the army, let alone on such a high-risk mission like this.Unfortunately, only the army has the resources for such an excursion to both conduct the sweep and gather sensitive intelligence from the countryside."Ring that old dog Fujimura right now - tell him Takamura wants a meeting in confidence as soon as he lets go of that bottle.""Oh and, don't bring the 헌병대 into this. Not yet, at leas."Takamura knows he has to act - and he has to act fast. Now, his entire premise hinges on whether the Army is willing to cooperate in his sweep.

japdlc.207.d코0=The revelation of the SACO documents began to take its grasp over the assembled politicians, leaving them perplexed momentarily. A degree of normalcy then returned to the room, before the Prime Minister dismissed his array of advisors. Just prior to exiting himself, the Home Minister announced that he would be contacting 헌병대 departments across the Sphere, in the hopes that they might now finally be able to narrow down the search.With the investigators now out in the field again, they were able to make some headway regarding the missing Admiral. A courier sent out of Shanghai was found to be carrying a package discreetly marked with the emblem of the Juntong, the intelligence service belonging to Dai Li. Interrogating the courier relieved that he had been paid a hefty sum to take the package from Shanghai to Hangzhou, where he would be again paid upon delivering the parcel to a location just outside the city. The man in question was certainly not the Admiral based upon the Courier's description, yet it was a solid lead nonetheless.Before proceeding any further with their mission, the agents delivered their report to the Home Minister, detailing the investigator's new hypothesis regarding the Admiral's current actions and whereabouts. While they were yet to confirm his exact location, the most obvious spot was now Shanghai. A large, coastal city, with a great deal of foreigners made for a good hideout for an American not looking for attention. General Fujiwara sent the investigators a simple response upon reading their report:""Move in on Shanghai, you will receive reinforcements soon. Surround the city and find Admiral Miles."

japdlc.208.d코0=Shanghai was filled with the agents of the 헌병대 and Tokko, from each and every direction. Some took up positions along the roads in and out of the city, while others used disguises in order to infiltrate the recesses of Shanghai's underbelly. They would slowly sink their claws into the city, sealing off each and every escape route with every passing day. If nothing else, the Admiral would be quite unable to leave without being seen. An invisible siege had just begun. While the investigating agents continued to widen their net over Shanghai, they turned their focus towards what identity Milton E. Miles might have assumed to blend into his new surroundings. As an American, the Admiral would already be limited in his options. He would need to remain in districts home to many foreigners, with the financial district coming to the minds of the investigators first. Miles was likely posing as a merchant, someone recognisable to his allies, but subtle enough to avoid suspicion.Then there was the issue of whether the Admiral was still in communication with the United States. There were undoubtedly other Americans working covertly in Shanghai, most of which would be working for the CIA in some direct or indirect capacity. Yet it was still too early to determine whether Miles would be among this group of his countrymen. He was a major threat to Japan first and foremost, regardless of who he counted among his allies.With that, another round of theorising was completed by the investigators as they sat around a dingy bar on the outskirts of Shanghai proper. It was now time to enter the Admiral's hiding grounds, and root him out by whatever means necessary.

He had been expecting an awful conspiracy to be uncovered, that the military was utterly compromised and posed to strike at the government. Yet now that he knew the truth, that he had been leading his entire ministry on a ghost hunt, he felt even more disturbed. There was no time to dwell on the matter, not when the Prime Minister needed to be informed as well.The office of his superior was lit only by the setting sun as the Home Minister entered, casting beams of pinkish light across the floor and right-hand wall.

"Sir, I have finally received the reports from my agents, they bring news of a great....but deeply troubling development that we could not have anticipated." <Prime minister's name> poured over the documents, while his minister could not help but watch the look of concern and spread over his face.Finally, the Prime Minister raised his head from the mass of papers. "But this suggests.... That Dai Li's return was little more than a byproduct of 헌병대 mismanagement. You cannot mean to tell me that we have been led astray by panic alone?" The Home Minister seemed to struggle with bringing forth the necessary words before finally speaking. "I-..I am afraid so, Sir. Our every investigative path leads us either to a dead end or back to the initial report. The rumour of Dai Li infiltrating the army simply falls apart when one examines the situation more closely. This has been a ploy to keep us distracted."It was the Prime Minister's turn to be without the capabilities of speech. He instead turned towards the window with his mouth covered by a hand, watching as the Sun disappeared over the horizon. The room fell into darkness. "I need you to find more proof of this disaster, raid every 헌병대 office if you must. This matter needs to die." As he spoke, the Prime Minister did not turn from the window.The Home Minister stood up from his seat, bowed and exited the room. Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] could not help but wonder...

There was indeed remnants of the Chinese Loyal Patriotic Army left in the far western regions of the country, but the claims of Dai Li hiding out in Chengde were nothing but lies.Secret police were moving in on any Chinese agents who have been deemed as "uncooperative" or even traitors. Nishi shuddered at their possible fates; the best such men could get from sabotage of the investigation was a swift hanging.Shunji's superior slammed the phone shut and stormed out of his office, veins bulging from under his skin with unbridled rage."It seems all our work since we started working with the bastard Chinese now must be destroyed." he gritted, "Every. Thing." He took a strained breath before returning to his office.

japdlc.406.d코0=Reports returned to us came with an upbeat attitude, as the 헌병대 had made a number of breakthroughs over the past few days regarding a series of high-profile letters, almost certainly from Juntong cells. Their origins stemmed from a number of locations in China, some from large cities while others feel into investigator's hands from far-flung villages and outposts, and each one contained a mess of jargon that still needed to be decoded. But the letters all were sent to a specific neighborhood, deep in the heart of Shanghai.According to members of the investigation and the 헌병대, the underbelly of Shanghai would serve as a likely hideout for Dai Li and other conspirators to vanish in. The sprawling harbor districts were notorious for hosting many illicit figures, and a vagabond rebel like Dai Li could hide among the Triad and no policeman would question it if he came out with his knees intact, and a small stack of bills.With our suspect's range shrunk to the limits of the city, we can probably catch the two before they get wind and flee from Shanghai. No gangster or rebel can throw off the trail now.

japdlc.408.d코0=The room was as isolated as could be. Deep in the labyrinth of government facilities underneath Tokyo's Intelligence Headquarters, guarded by security agents unmatched in skill, and buried beneath nearly 30 meters of asphalt, concrete, and steel, two men sat in a bare room."Mr. Isuzu, I hope you understand the utmost seriousness of filing a report of treason in this investigation." the investigator said, eerily calm underneath the humming incandent bulb. "If your claim is even the slightest bit incorrect, you will be terminated from this investigation at the least."Mr. Isuzu's eyes darted frantically across the room. He had a theory yes, but who else would believe it? It would bring the whole investigation crashing down, perhaps even the country. It made no sense, but he felt it to be the case."Investigator Kawashima, I work for the decryption department. We've been seeing nothing but failure in our efforts. Every day the 헌병대 deliver us piles upon piles of 'acquired documents' from raids, but there is no pattern." He cleared his throat before continuing, "These papers are not code, they are completely random characters and words thrown together."The investigator took a cigarette out from his pocket, "Isn't it your job to separate this randomness? I do understand the delays in codebreaking, and I can tell you there are people far more powerful than either of us who want it done now.""Investigator, I am telling you, look at this!" Mr. Isuzu opened a folder of documents, labelled as unimportant. "There is no pattern. We have checked this against Juntong codes, German, American, even old Russian ones! The 헌병대 are giving us pointless documents that are not unsolvable, but not even meant to be solved.""Dai Li could just be-"In a moment of defiance, perhaps Mr. Isuzu's most daring action of his life, he cut off Kawashima. "The 헌병대 are sending these, Investigator. I cannot see any other answer. I swear to you it is true, Investigator Kawashima!" He grew more frantic with each sentence, slamming his fist down on the metal table. "They're giving us nothing! Nothing! You can ask anyone else! I swear!" all the while, Mr. Kawashima looked on in cold anger."The 헌병대 are hiding something, I can feel it. Please, look into it! Do it for yourself, for our empire! They are not telling us everything!"When Mr. Isuzu collapsed into his seat, his voice hoarse, Mr. Kawashima looked at him with a mix of shock and fury. He felt his blood seethe as this lone technician raved about the 헌병대. It couldn't be true. He was a madman, driven to lunacy in order to justify his lack of progress. He stood up and left the room, gathering Mr. Isuzu's files with him. Before he closed the heavy door, he remarked, with the thought beginning to gnaw at his mind, that maybe this seemingly crazed man had an inkling of truth to his theory.

japdlc.501.d코0=Despite being the ones to initially bring up the matter of Dai Li's possible infiltration of the military, the 헌병대 had since then kept rather quiet on the matter. While their aid in bringing the matter to the attention of the Home Minister was a significant sign of loyalty and trust, some of the investigating officers wondered if the 헌병대's newfound silence was a cause of concern. It might have been possible that Dai Li had infiltrated their lower ranks too, in order to remain one step ahead of his adversariesDespite their well-meaning and ultimately friendly request to examine the 헌병대 for signs of conspirator infiltration, the investigators were told to stand down by the military upon each attempt they made. Even the Home Minister received a sign of the military's scrutiny, in the form of a letter, encouraging him to "focus his attention on the actual investigation". Not wanting to be seemingly pacified by these idle demands to both himself and his investigators, the Home Minister began to consider what he could do to break through the military blockade. There were still many within the army and navy who he could count as allies. Some even owed him favors going years back. The Minister had a few phone calls to make and even a couple of letters to write.Within a few days, the investigators were finally granted access to sections of the army and navy's records, particularly regarding finance. It was, at the very least, a decent starting point. In order to investigate the 헌병대 themselves, they would need to discover the reasons for the military's stubbornness. Hopefully, they would crack without too much resistance.

japdlc.503.d코0=The Investigation was, on the surface, going well. The agents were not treated particularly well by their hosts across a number of army offices and barracks. They were met with stern and almost defiant glances as they went about their work. Files arrived on time and interviews were carried out, always together with those seemingly ubiquitous looks of anger. Yet the agents were still able to carry out their task, albeit with an uncomfortable aura around them at all times. The investigation swept through a number of low level sections of the army and in seemingly very little time. The daunting and dangerous upper levels were next.Fortunately for them, there would be a number of assets, courtesy of the Home Minister, to aid them. A number of "aligned" army personnel would make sure the operation ran smoothly. If one soldier refused to deliver a document, it would soon enough be delivered by a superior officer. Interviews went by without too much difficulty, as a word or two from the Home Minister kept the army mostly in check. It was enough to make the officers know that cooperation would lead to a hastened promotion and not a hastened retirement. All in all, the assistance of the Home Minister was more than enough to aid his investigation.Among the plethora of unusual and suspicious documents collected by the investigating agents, a selection of financial records stood out the most. The first detail of note, was that they concerned a number of 헌병대 officers. The second detail was that these officers had become obscenely wealthy over the course of only a few weeks. Money had seeming been poured into the welfare of these Military Police Officers, yet at no point did the record state why this had been authorised.A new series of interviews, all approved with great reluctance, by the Minister of War, were conducted. Some of the soldiers had heard rumours of fortunes materialising for certain officers among the 헌병대. What these rumours hadn't told them anything of a source for the yen, the soldiers had come to an agreed hypothesis. It was simple enough, the 헌병대 was now in the business of accepting particularly large bribes.

japdlc.507.d코0=While the 헌병대 officers were currently out of reach, having been reported as "out on covert assignment", their families were not. Fortunately for the investigation, that was where the trail of money led them. The 헌병대 official's suddenly discovered fortunes had not been sent directly to their bank accounts. Instead, the money had gone towards their close relations, whether that be their girlfriends, wives, parents or siblings.The interviews with these relatives went well. Some coaxing was initially required, as many of them felt anxious about their money possibly being taken away from them. Their fears were eventually quelled with the realisation of the investigators actual interest. Among those questioned, the universal story was that of a charitable donation having been made to them due to their 헌병대 family member. The benefactor was always anonymous, at least to the recipients of their money.Theories raged as to just where the money could be coming from. Naturally, there were many ideas tossed about beyond the money merely coming from Dai Li, or an associate of his. Some suggested interference from powerful business groups, perhaps a Keiretsu trying to utilise members of the 헌병대 against their competitors. Possible American involvement was the idea that intrigued the investigators most. They wouldn't put it past the CIA to attempt to corrupt part of the military police into leaking valuable information or to overlook one or two spies.Hypotheses aside, there was still much work to do to verify any one of them. The reports of mysterious sums of yen appearing out of thin air were certainly not good signs, no matter who the cash originally belonged to in the first place. The paper trail was there, the agents needed only to locate it.

japdlc.510.d코0=As they so often do, the trail was found far from where the investigation had least expected it. The Home Minister, as per his job description, had contacts in virtually every branch of the Japanese government and military. Most rumours therefore made their way to his ears sooner or later. Loose lips in the war ministry provided him with a rather peculiar fact. A number of 헌병대 officers were on their way to Shanghai. Not only this, but orders supposedly from a Dai Li agent had just been intercepted outside the city. It was simply too big of a coincidence for the investigation to pass up on.With a sense of direction restored, the investigating agents rushed to their new target. The investigation would look towards local officials for possible leads. A large enough bribe or a serious enough threat made all but the most stubborn of them comply with the investigation. Piece by piece, the trail reformd once again, All of the 헌병대 agents had booked into the Astor House Hotel.It was simple enough to "win" the hotel over to their side . A phone call from the Home Minister assured the Astor House's manager that they would receive a rather generous donation should they comply with the investigation's demands. Relatively few of the officers left the hotel for more than a stroll through the streets, most stayed in their rooms or gathered in the lobby to discuss trivial matters. Yet after about two days of this seemingly dull routine, the officers would one by one visit the reception desk and book themselves into the conference room. They would all be attending some sort of meeting between two and five o'clock the next day, and at least two unnamed individuals would be joining them.As the day of the meeting arrived, the investigation, together with local police units stood ready to burst into the hotel conference room and arrest all those present. For that to happen, they would need the express approval of the senior investigating officer, who acted as an emissary for the Home Minister. Until he gave the command, the agents of the Home Ministry would watch the meeting, lest they miss some important building.

japdlc.512.d코0="There's still plenty of time and they are unaware of our presence". By order of their senior officer, the investigation would hold off on their strike against the 헌병대. They had three hours to witness a crime taking place. After that, the officers would disperse around the building, making it much harder to take them in for questioning. For the moment, the agents of the Home Minister would stand by, waiting for the proper moment to arrest everyone inside the conference room. Observations continued, as they were joined by members of the Shanghai police force.The conference itself was proving to be rather dull. Although it had officially begun, the 헌병대 officers present were still idly talking amongst themselves, with seemingly no coherent conversation between the lot of them. They could only be awaiting something to happen, that was seemingly out of their hands. An hour passed and still nothing happened. From their vantage point in a dubiously acquired apartment across the street, the agents could see the senior 헌병대 being to check his watch more frequently. They were overdue for something to happen, possibly a late arrival.Another hour passed and the mood in the conference room was growing more and more uneasy. They had been aware of some sort of delay, but nothing of this length. The conference would be over, at least officially, in just under one hour. All the agents could do, was continue to wait.

japdlc.513.d코0="Enter the building, arrest everyone in that room". With that, the agents of the Home Ministry descended upon the Astor House Hotel. The conference room was quickly surrounded on every side. Had any of the 헌병대 considered exiting through a third storey window, then their last sight would have been of their mangled body being handcuffed by agents awaiting them on the street below. Not one of the assembled figures took a second look at the windows.The actual arrests were smooth enough. The officers in the conference room quietly surrendered themselves and were handcuffed, saying nothing as they were escorted out of the hotel through a back door. The Shanghai police force had been enthusiastic in aiding the operation, with more than a little contempt on display for the 헌병대. Despite the occasional punch or baton to the stomach, the prisoners arrived mostly in one piece. They were to be isolated from one another, with each one getting their own remote cell. Interviews began shortly after, before any one of the 헌병대 officers had time to devise a smart enough alibi.It quickly became clear that the 헌병대 were more than prepared for being questioned. They all remained calm during their questioning, speaking only to answer questions and always giving a succinct answer. As more time passed without the investigation being able to extract any information from the 헌병대 officers, the more dangerous their imprisonment became. Sooner or later, the army would get word of the conference having been raided, and begin causing a serious diplomatic meltdown back in Japan. Time was running out for the investigating agents.

japdlc.515.d코0=It was a quarter to three. Outside the Astor House, the agents of the Home Minister's investigation were still waiting for signs of a crime taking place in the conference room of the hotel. A way of discomfort was beginning to set in over the investigation, as they wondered if this had all been ruse, designed to draw their attention while the real clandestine gathering went on undetected. This unease seemed to grow all the more real as the seconds ticked by, summoning up images of the Home Ministry agents being caught in a trap themselves. Just as quickly as those images were summoned, they were then banished by an agent speaking over the radio..."Wait...I think we might finally have something\". A particularly unremarkable man, who had nearly escaped the attention of the agent stationed near the hotel's entrance, had just entered the conference room. To the agents monitoring the development from afar, he looked as though he might have been just another 헌병대 officer, using a heavy coat and wide-brimmed hat to cover disguise himself out on the streets. Yet as he removed his garments, it became clear that he was very much not just another of the assembled men.His clothes were not what caught the eyes of the agents, but his face. That was a face they had seen before. During the very beginning of the investigation, a dossier containing files on anyone close to Dai Li not accounted for during war had been passed around. The very same face had appeared in an old photograph of Dai Li, standing right beside him. The man in Astor House had aged of course, but it could be him.A near deathly silence took hold over the agents, as they watched the 헌병대 calmly listen to the Dai Li operative, as if they had all met many times before and become the most trusted of allies. Finally, the Home Ministry's senior agent gave the command:"

japdlc.517.d코0=Although recovering from his fall, the chinese contact was still able to communicate through all the pain. He would remain bedridden and covered in a number of plaster casts. The contact would receive just enough care to keep him alive and slowly recovering, but not enough comfort to allow him to relax in the face of interrogation. While the investigation might need to hold off on their most aggressive and uncomfortable methods, there were still plenty of options for how they could squeeze information out of the Dai Li operative.The 헌병대 agents on the other hand, were left in their cells. The investigation had little interest in the mere acomplacies of the Dai Li, especially now that they had a direct link to the man himself. By keeping them merely locked up and well fed, the army could do little more than grumble. They of course would demand the release of the 헌병대 officers, but beyond that they were essentially powerless as long as the officers were not directly harmed.Without any form of anaesthetic, the chinese contact was in constant pain. His broken limbs were suspended to keep them straight while healing, only served to drag out his excruciating experience. An anaesthetic was of course readily available, as the agents were ever so willing to inform him. There was a catch, as expected. The anaesthetic was available to him should he be willing to part with everything he knew about Dai Li and his connections to the Japanese army. He was asked to answer this on several occasions, but the agents would always be met with a blank stare. Even when they put just a little bit of pressure on his broken bones, they would only elicit a slight wince or twinge, never more.The investigation, although disappointed with their captives unwillingness to cooperate, was still confident that he would snap sooner or later. The contact was struggling to sleep, and his eyes seemed dimmer each time they paid him a visit. He was growing weary, but that would not prevent him from being kept alive for as long as the investigation needed him. Time was all they really needed, anyway.

japdlc.518.d코0=Sometimes, when one is trying to extract information from a stubborn source, one is forced to rely on older methods of interrogation. This was the case with the investigation and their newly "acquired" 헌병대 prisoners. While they were hardened men of military background, there were still a number of methods that could prove effective. Many of those methods were ones that the 헌병대 had employed themselves, tried and tested across the sphere. The native Shanghai police had been particularly forthcoming with the details of this methods of interrogation, having heard the stories of their application over the years. Behind clothes and bolted doors, the agents of the investigation began their bloody and agonizing work.One by one, the 헌병대 officers were escorted to a small room at the back of the police station. After an invariable amount of time, they would return. Some had been cut, others beaten, some had been burned and others seemingly electrocuted. The investigation knew that they could withstand most forms of torture, and that killing one of them "by mistake" would not soften them up during questioning. This would be a battle of attrition. The longer that they were locked up, away from the wider world, the more worn down they would become. If they started to believe that no help was coming for them, then they would snap. After all, if this was loyalty's reward, then what good was keeping military secrets, really?The military had been aware of the matter for some time, however. The dramatic raid of the Astor House has been hard for them to miss. Army intelligence was quickly able to locate where the 헌병대 officers were being held. With the knowledge that the 헌병대 officers were being detained, the war ministry was swift to issue a diplomatic protest against the investigation. While the Home Minister would keep the army busy by means of rescheduling their meetings about the matter at the last moment, the investigation would continue their interrogations. As long as the 헌병대 were kept ignorant of the world outside, then they would eventually tell the agents everything they needed to know...

japdlc.519.d코0=The arrests were carried out quickly, perhaps too quickly. The agents of the home ministry, together with the shanghai police made their way into the third storey conference room, where they found all of the 헌병대 agents still seated. However, the agents just caught sight of the Chinese contact turning a corner down the hallway. He could only be heading to the emergency exits. While the the police were left to deal with the men in the conference room, two agents pursued the chinese contact down the hall.By the time they had managed to turn the corner, he had already made his way through the emergency exit. The alarm connected to the door now blared throughout the hallway, causing a panicked wave of hotel guests to exit their rooms. The agents were forced to shove their way past as dozens of guests tried to rush towards the exits. After barging their way through, the agents were greeted by the sight of two of their own at the bottom of the spiral staircase. They had seen the contact for a split second, before he had disappeared back into the hotel through the first storey door. Blocked by the mass of guests descending the stairs at the same time, the agents awaiting below had no chance to fire upon him.Entering the hotel once again, the now four agents followed the trail of opened doors. With no rooms on these floors, he could only have attempted to leave through another fire escape, the main entrance or a staff entrance. Yet these paths would have this point been blocked off to him, any attempt would have resulted in arrest or death. The contact's trail did not seem to lead him towards said dead ends, instead heading for...As the agents burst through the swinging double doors of the delivery bay, they caught sight of the contact driving off in one of the vans that had been halfway through unloading ingredients for the evening meals. By the time anyone had a gun in hand, he was totally out of reach, the sounds of the serving van echoing through the busy streets of Shanghai.

japdlc.520.d코0=The low-hanging lamp slowly swayed back and forth across the stuffy prison cell. Two agents of the Home Ministry loomed over a single 헌병대 officer. The sharp ticking of a clock was the only sound to permeate the room, until a seemingly invisible mosquito began to fly through the humid air."Again, would you tell us about these recent donations that were made to your colleagues"The officer repeated the same answer that he had given them a dozen times before, that he had no idea about such donations and that he was uncertain why he was being interrogated in the first place. He finished his retort with a brief chuckle. Deciding that their prisoner was perhaps growing too comfortable with his present conditions, one of the agents grabbed him by the face and thrust him to the ground."The time for answers is now. If you continue to fail to understand your situation, you will suffer worse by the end of the day."Dazed by the pain at the back of his head, the 헌병대 officer continued to lay on the floor. As he did so, the two agents circled above him, as if they were vultures about to feast on a dying animal."It would be simple enough for us to make you disappear. Do you think your colleagues will want you alive after what you have told us already?"As if in response, the officer's eyes snapped open. He attempted to lift himself back up but was forced to the ground again. His eyes became fixed to the ceiling for a good moment, before he exhaled."You're never going to find Dai Li. We don't know where he is. We don't even know if he is alive. The report we gave you was nothing short of an investigative travesty. Yet here you are,at your wit's end, looking for ghosts and conspiracies! "He laughed again, before a kick to the ribs cut him short. The officer spluttered on the floor, before resuming his answer. This time, there was a rage in his voice, as if the kick had only made him more desperate to speak."Ask any one of my peers these questions enough, and they will snap, and then tell you exactly what I am telling you now. The Dai Li you want is nothing more than a story that we cooked up, to cover our own asses! Now, you have your answer.His final attempt to rise from the ground awarded him a kick to the face. It knocked him out cold. The guard sent in to remove the unconscious officer found the two agents sitting in opposite corners of the room with their heads in their laps. Not one to ask conquestions, he did what was asked of him and dragged the officer to the infirmary. The ticking of a clock and the buzzing of a mosquito filled the air once more.

japdlc.521.d코0=Fortunately for the investigation, the army would not be acting within their rights if they were to try to "rescue" the 헌병대 officers. Even with this fact, the agents elected to use more reasonable and subtle measures to acquire the information they needed. One would have been foolish to write all of the prisoners off as die-hard military loyalists, as shown by their willingness to take bribes from mysterious benefactors. Perhaps if their financial situations were to be taken care off, then they would be open to discussing their backroom deals.Other methods were employed too. Officers who had expressed great faith in the military soon arriving to release them were specifically told that they had been abandoned by their superiors. Some of the 헌병대 were subjected to volleys of questions, that were directed to them at random with either a great deal of aggression or geniality.Stubbornness had been expected, considered by the investigation to be part and parcel when dealing with members of the military. Yet breaking them down was certainly not impossible. Cut off from the world, isolated from even each other and subjected to constant and repetitive questioning, the signs of their slipping composure would soon become more and more apparent. Eventually, their hope of the military intervening would begin to fade.

japdlc.522.d코0=Strapped to a table in a prison cell, the chinese contact of Dai Li was once again being interrogated.. He was dazed from the pain, and now more dazed from the lamp being shined in his eyes to prevent him from falling asleep. This was the third night of this routine. "We are almost as tired as you at this point, why were you meeting with officers of the 헌병대?"No response. The Chinese Contact never spoke, his only method of response was to stare. He now always stared right into the eyes of his captives. The only respite he afforded them was when he lowered his eyelids momentarily. The agent holding the lamp seemed to finally suffer the effects of the staring, as he lowered the light and turned to face his colleague. "He's not going to speak, we should consider other-"A gloved hand struck the contact, sending a wave of pain across his face. Then it happened again. And then again. It was on the fifth strike that the ringing in his ears began. He watched the two agents argue with each other, catching echoes of their words through the din. The contact cleared his throat, which produced a loud and phlegm-filled wheeze. He was once again met with two pairs of vicious eyes. "When this all began, did the behaviour of the 헌병대 not trouble you? Did you not question how forthcoming they were about Dai Li? Did you even examine any of the information they sent you?"The investigating agents leaned in, to better hear his sudden confession. They demanded an explanation, that he reveal exactly what he was referring to."I worked for Dai Li, but that was decades ago. I have no idea what has become of him. As far as I know, Dai Li could be living as a hermit in Tibet! Ever since the war ended, the 헌병대 have been forcing me to snuff out resistance movements in China, if they knew where he was, I would have been used against him at this point.He was struck across the face again and called a bad liar by his captors. "Surely everything you have gathered up to this point confirms this! Why were they so forthcoming with the rumours of Dai Li, haunting the countryside and murdering unsuspecting Japanese soldiers? Why tell you this, and then refuse to aid you in any meaningful way? Every time you've lifted the curtain just a little bit higher than the 헌병대, what have you found? Nothing. "The agents of the investigation did not respond when the chinese contact finished giving them the answer to the question they had asked him so many times. One stared at the floor, while the other rested his head against the cool brick wall. It was just about beginning to click into place. One report from the 헌병대 had spawned all this. A mere whisper of a ghost haunting China had sent the entire political establishment into a thunderous panic.The agent with his head against the wall produced a sigh of both great anguish and great relief. "Phone the Home Minister, tell him that investigation has taken a new turn. Tell him that, and that we are on our way to Nanjing"

Now, [Root.GetLeader] can only hope that the efforts to restore contact with the Daihon’ei, and after that, an attempt to reach out to individual Army and Navy commands will be successful.Except, the Daihon’ei, Army and Navy still have not restored contact with the Cabinet, let alone the Prime Minister’s office. [Root.GetLeader] has tried going through the front door, and so far little fruit has been bore. Perhaps, he thought to himself, it’s finally time to do some wetwork.[Root.GetLeader] scrolls through the Rolodex on his front desk, scrolling through the contact numbers and telegram points of anyone who is still deemed loyal, or can be convinced to obey the orders of the civilian government, through coercion or otherwise. To his side lies a 헌병대 dossier, with an attached picture and several noted details of business connections and travel histories, all important in this time of necessity.Fujimura K. 헌병대. Communications company, Chiyoda Branch. Colonel (acting) Kawasaki N. Imperial Japanese Army. 23rd Infantry Regiment, 18th Infantry Division. Stationed in Tohoku. Colonel.Sato M.

Clicking his feet and nervously grasping the file in his hands, his mind wonders as to how he is going to break the abysmal news to him. The Great Conspiracy appears to have been shot dead in its tracks when the Daihon'ei got their house in order. Now, it has become apparent that the conspiracy has expanded far and beyond, far and beyond any point the administration is comfortable with."Enter".Iwaichi Fujiwara gives the Prime Minister a bow, the air palpable with the musk of bad news."Sit down, Daijin-san. Is it as bad as I think it is?""Well, it's gone above and beyond what's appropriate, to put it frankly. Three hundred and fucking seventy-eight defendants sentenced to death. At this rate we're going to promote privates to colonels in a fucking week, if we don't-"[Root.GetLeader] gestures the Security Minister to keep quiet, before gesturing towards the dossier on the table. The pictures of military officers, some even personally acquainted through functions and military balls marked out with red crosses and the seal of the Supreme Court reflected a glint of regret in the Prime Minister's eyes. Has this gone too far? Would purging these officers really solve the Great Conspiracy? What does this mean to Japan itself? These questions would remain unanswered, at least for now."What about the public?""The jury went rampant - decorum was nigh impossible in the Court. The usual ramblings, calling the defendants traitors, calling for their heads.""At least we can still stifle public opinion from turning against us. Now, here's what I want you to do, and listen very carefully. Contact the Tokyo 헌병대 district commander, give him this ministerial directive and tell him it's Code Akari. Absolutely make sure the Judiciary doesn't catch wind of this."Iwaichi Fujiwara packs up the dossier's contents, gives the Prime Minister a short bow, and leaves for the Tokyo 헌병대 headquarters.

There he sat at his separate table, where he seemed much further away from his advisors than usual. The news of Nishi's trial had not been received well by the Chrysanthemum Throne, a feeling that he expressed plainly on his face. The Emperor had even arrived late to the privy council meeting, which was particularly unusual. For half an hour, he had remained silent, barely even moving his eyes to look at the assembled council. Even the words of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal had not stirred the Emperor enough to say even a simple 'yes' or a 'no'. Regardless, the Privy Council was desperate for the Emperor to speak, as it seemed increasingly likely that his voice would be the only thing that would calm the country. Protests against Nishi's sentence had become increasingly common and most were growing in size by the day. No amount of policing or promises by the government had so far worked. Indeed, the Emperor's voice was in fact their last chance."Your Imperial Majesty, we once again beg of you to consider our request. Think of your subjects, think of your Empire!"Without as much as a word, or a chance in his facial expression, the Emperor stood up and departed from the room. The Privy Council President returned to his seat, too stunned to comment on what had just happened. The rest of the council were similarly shocked. Some  around the room, hoping that someone would take the initiative to speak up. Others could barely look up from their papers. The silence of the Chrysanthemum Throne was more damning than any blunt refusal he could have uttered.

Hearing tumbling down the corridor, soldiers crashed into the room, armed to the teeth with rifles and dressed in modern military equipment. 강렬한 빛줄기가 방 안을 비추었지만,  Rather, he turned to them and looked them up and down, before swiveling his head back to pay attention to the darkened sky."I know why you're here," he uttered calmly after an officer yelled his name, throwing a glass across the room to intimidate him, "I know that I can't stop this, either."The soldiers, in awe of Takagi's stoic tranquility, were paralyzed where they stood and unable to act on their orders. They glimpsed back at a commanding officer for approval, though he himself had a look of concern smeared over his face."Gentlemen, I will do you the honors, if you would let me. Pass me the blade, and I will die without bringing shame upon this family."After a few moments, Takagi looked to the officer from across the room with a cool expression; he welcomed death, but his request for the tanto knife fell on deaf ears. A bullet shot through Takagi's head, spewing blood across the cream-white walls of the room as his body collapsed to its side. The officer, overcome with reverence and shame, could not bear to see the lifeless body and stormed out of the room, leaving his men to gaze at the corpse for a few minutes longer.
